This will enable us to use\\nthem later for the discussion of the atomic structure and interaction\\nbetween atoms and light.\\n\\nThis is the first lecture of the Advanced Atomic Physics course at\\nHeidelberg University, as tought in the wintersemester 2019/2020. It is\\nintended for master students, which have a basic understanding of\\nquantum mechanics and electromagnetism. In total, we will study multiple\\ntopics of modern atomic, molecular and optical physics over a total of\\n24 lectures, where each lectures is approximately 90 minutes.\\n\\n- We will start the series with some basics on quantum mechanics.\\n\\n- Then work our way into the harmonic oscillator and the hydrogen\\n  atom.\\n\\n- We will then leave the path of increasingly complex atoms for a\\n  moment to have some fun with light-propagation, lasers and\\n  discussion of the Bell inequalities.\\n\\n- A discussion of more complex atoms gives us the acutual tools at\\n  hand that are in the lab.\\n\\n- This sets up a discussion of di-atomic molecules, which ends the\\n  old-school AMO.\\n\\n- We move on to quantized atom-light interaction, the Jaynes Cummings\\n  model and strong-field lasers.\\n\\n- We will finally finish with modern ways to implement quantum\\n  simulators and quantum computers.\\n\\nThe topics of the lectures will be discussed in more details in the\\nassociated tutorials.\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nIn AMO physics we will encounter the consequences of quantum mechanics\\nall the time. So we will start out with a review of the basic\\ningredients to facilitate the later discussion of the experiments.\\n\\nSome good introductions on the traditional approach can be found in\\n[^2002], [^2006], [^CT1], [^CT2]. Previously, we mostly followed the discussion\\nof Ref. [^2006]. Nowadays, I also recommend the works by Scott Aaronson in [this](https://scottaaronson.com/democritus/lec9.html) and [this lecture](https://www.scottaaronson.com/barbados-2016.pdf). There is also a good [article by\\nQuanta-Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/quantum-theory-rebuilt-from-simple-physical-principles-20170830/#)\\non the whole effort to derive quantum mechanics from some simple\\nprinciples. This effort started with [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0101012v4), which actually\\nmakes for a nice read.\\n\\nBefore we start with the detailled cooking recipe let us give you some\\nexamples of quantum systems, which are of major importance throughout\\nthe lecture:\\n\\n1.  _Orbit in an atom, molecule etc_. Most of you might have studied\\n    this during the introduction into quantum mechanics.\\n\\n2.  _Occupation number of a photon mode_. Any person working on quantum\\n    optics has to understand the quantum properties of photons.\\n\\n3.  _Position of an atom_ is of great importance for double slit\\n    experiments, the quantum simulation of condensed matter systems with\\n    atoms, or matterwave experiments.\\n\\n4.  The _spin degree of freedom_ of an atom like in the historical\\n    Stern-Gerlach experiment.\\n\\n5.  The classical coin-toss or bit, which connects us nicely to simple\\n    classical probability theory or computing\\n\\n# The possible outcomes (the Hilbert Space) for the Problem in Question\\n\\nThe first step is to identify the right Hilbert space for your problem.\\nFor a classical problem, we would simply list all the different possible\\noutcomes in a list $$(p_1, \\\\cdots, p_N)$$ of _real_ numbers. As one of the\\noutcomes has to happen, we obtain the normalization condition:\\n\\n\`\`\`math\\n \\\\sum_i p_i = 1\\n\`\`\`\\n\\nIn quantum mechanics, we follow a similar approach of first identifying\\nthe possible outcomes. But instead of describing the outcomes with real\\nnumbers, we now associate a complex number $$\\\\alpha_i$$ to each outcome\\n$$(\\\\alpha_1, \\\\cdots, \\\\alpha_N)$$, with $$\\\\alpha_i \\\\in \\\\mathbb{C}$$. Given\\nthat they should also describe some probability they have to be\\nnormalized to one, but now we have the condition:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\sum_i |\\\\alpha_i|^2 = 1\\n$$\\n\\nAaronson claims that this is just measuring probabilities in in $L_2$\\nnorm. I would highly recommend his discussions on his blog for a more\\ninstructive derivation[@quantum]. Next we will not use the traditional\\nlists, but the bra-ket notation, by writing:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\left|\\\\psi\\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\sum_i \\\\alpha_i \\\\left|i\\\\right\\\\rangle\\n$$\\n\\nAnd given that these are complex vectors, we will measure their overlap\\nthrough a Hermitian scalar product\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\langle\\\\psi_1 \\\\psi_2\\\\rangle=(\\\\langle{\\\\psi_2}| \\\\psi_1\\\\rangle)^*.\\n$$\\n\\n## The coin toss\\n\\nThe situation becomes particularly nice to follow for the two level\\nsystem or the coin toss. In classical systems, we will get heads up\\n$\\\\uparrow$ with a certain probability p. So the inverse $\\\\downarrow$\\narrives with likelyhood $1-p$. We would then classical list the\\nprobabilities with $(p,1-p)$. In the quantum world we achieve such a\\ncoin for example in spin 1/2 systems or qubits in general. We will then\\ndescribe the system through the state:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\left|\\\\psi\\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\alpha_\\\\uparrow \\\\left|\\\\uparrow\\\\right\\\\rangle + \\\\alpha_\\\\downarrow \\\\left|\\\\downarrow\\\\right\\\\rangle  \\\\qquad \\\\text{with} \\\\; \\\\langle\\\\psi | \\\\psi\\\\rangle = 1.\\n$$\\n\\nThe next problem is how to act on the system in the classical world or\\nin the quantum world.\\n\\n## Quantum rules\\n\\nHaving set up the space on which we want to act we have to follow the\\nrules of quantum mechanics. The informal way of describing is actually\\nnicely described by Chris Monroe [in this\\nvideo](https://youtu.be/CC7nlBM2cSM). We might summarize them as\\nfollows:\\n\\n1.  Quantum objects can be in several states at the same time.\\n\\n2.  Rule number one only works when you are not looking.\\n\\nThe more methematical fashion is two say that there two ways of\\nmanipulating quantum states:\\n\\n1.  Unitary transformations $\\\\hat{U}$.\\n\\n2.  Measurements.\\n\\n# Unitary transformations\\n\\nAs states change and evolve, we know that the total probability should\\nbe conserved. So we transform the state by some operator $\\\\hat{U}$,\\nwhich just maps the state\\n$\\\\left|\\\\psi\\\\right\\\\rangle\\\\xrightarrow[]{U}\\\\left|\\\\psi'\\\\right\\\\rangle$.\\nThis should not change the norm, and we obtain the condition:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\left\\\\langle\\\\psi\\\\right|\\\\hat{U}^\\\\dag\\\\hat{U} \\\\left|\\\\psi\\\\right\\\\rangle = 1\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\hat{U}^\\\\dag\\\\hat{U}  = \\\\mathbb{1}\\n$$\\n\\nThat's the very definition of unitary operators and\\nunitary matrices. Going back to the case of a coin toss, we see that we\\ncan then transform our qubit through the unitary operator:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\hat{U}=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}\\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{cc}\\n1 & -1\\\\\\\\\\n1 & 1\\n\\\\end{array}\\\\right)\\n$$\\n\\nApplying it on the previously defined states $\\\\uparrow$\\nand $\\\\downarrow$, we get the superposition state:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\hat{U}\\\\left|\\\\uparrow\\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\frac{\\\\left|\\\\uparrow\\\\right\\\\rangle-\\\\left|\\\\downarrow\\\\right\\\\rangle}{\\\\sqrt{2}}\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\hat{U}\\\\left|\\\\downarrow\\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\frac{\\\\left|\\\\uparrow\\\\right\\\\rangle+\\\\left|\\\\downarrow\\\\right\\\\rangle}{\\\\sqrt{2}}\\n$$\\n\\nAs we use the unitary matrices we also see why we might\\none to use complex numbers. Imagine that we would like to do something\\nthat is roughly the square root of the unitary, which often just means\\nthat the system should evolve for half the time as we will see later. If\\nwe then have negative nummbers, they will immediately become imaginary.\\n\\nSuch superposition would not be possible in the classical case, as\\nnon-negative values are forbidden there. Actually, operations on\\nclassical propability distributions are only possible if every entry of\\nthe matrix is non-negative (probabilities are never negative right ?)\\nand each column adds up to one (we cannot loose something in a\\ntransformation). Such matrices are called .\\n\\n# Observables and Measurements\\n\\nAs much fun as it might be to manipulate a quantum state, we also have\\nto measure it and how it connects to the properties of the system at\\nhand. Any given physical quantity $A$ is associated with a Hermitian\\noperator $\\\\hat{A} = \\\\hat{A}^\\\\dag$ acting in the Hilbert space of the\\nsystem, which we defined previously. Please, be utterly aware that those\\nHermitian operators have absolutely no need to be unitary. However, any\\nunitary operator might be written as $\\\\hat{U}= e^{i\\\\hat{A}}$.\\n\\nIn a _measurement_ , the possible outcomes are then the eigenvalues\\n$a_\\\\alpha$ of the operator $\\\\hat{A}$:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\hat{A}\\\\left|\\\\alpha\\\\right\\\\rangle=a_{\\\\alpha}\\\\left|\\\\alpha\\\\right\\\\rangle.\\n$$\\n\\nThe system will collapse to the corresponding\\neigenvector and the probability of finding the system in state\\n$\\\\left|\\\\alpha\\\\right\\\\rangle$ is\\n\\n$$\\nP(\\\\left|\\\\alpha\\\\right\\\\rangle)=||\\\\hat{P}_{\\\\left|\\\\alpha\\\\right\\\\rangle} \\\\left|\\\\psi\\\\right\\\\rangle||^2 = \\\\left\\\\langle\\\\psi\\\\right| \\\\hat{P}^{\\\\dag}_{\\\\left|\\\\alpha\\\\right\\\\rangle} \\\\hat{P}_{\\\\left|\\\\alpha\\\\right\\\\rangle} \\\\left|\\\\psi\\\\right\\\\rangle,\\n$$\\n\\nwhere\\n$\\\\hat{P}_{\\\\left|\\\\alpha\\\\right\\\\rangle}= \\\\left|\\\\alpha\\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\left\\\\langle\\\\alpha\\\\right|$.\\n\\nAs for our previous examples, how would you measure them typically, i.e.\\nwhat would be the operator ?\\n\\n1.  In atoms the operators will be angular moment, radius, vibrations\\n    etc.\\n\\n2.  For the occupation number we have nowadays number counting\\n    photodectors.\\n\\n3.  The position of an atom might be detected through high-resolution\\n    CCD cameras.\\n\\n4.  For the _measurement of the spin_, we typically correlate the\\n    internal degree of freedom to the spatial degree of freedom. This is\\n    done by applying a magnetic field gradient acting on the magnetic\\n    moment $\\\\hat{\\\\vec{\\\\mu}}$ , which in turn is associated with the spin\\n    via $\\\\hat{\\\\vec{\\\\mu}} = g \\\\mu_B \\\\hat{\\\\vec{s}}/\\\\hbar$, where $g$ is\\n    the Landé $g$-factor and $\\\\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton . The energy\\n    of the system is $\\\\hat{H} = -\\\\hat{\\\\vec{\\\\mu}} \\\\cdot \\\\vec{B}$.\\n\\n# Time Evolution\\n\\nBeing able to access the operator values and intialize the wavefunction\\nin some way, we also want to have a prediction on its time-evolution.\\nFor most cases of this lecture we can simply describe the system by the\\nnon-relativistic **Schrödinger Equation.** It reads\\n\\n$$\\ni\\\\hbar\\\\partial_t\\\\left|\\\\psi(t)\\\\right\\\\rangle=\\\\hat{H}(t)\\\\left|\\\\psi(t)\\\\right\\\\rangle.\\n$$\\n\\nIn general, the Hamilton operator $\\\\hat{H}$ is\\ntime-dependent. For a time-independent Hamilton operator $\\\\hat{H}$, we\\ncan find eigenstates $\\\\left|\\\\phi_n\\\\right\\\\rangle$ with\\ncorresponding eigenenergies $E_n$ :\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\hat{H}\\\\left|\\\\phi_n\\\\right\\\\rangle=E_n\\\\left|\\\\phi_n\\\\right\\\\rangle.\\n$$\\n\\nThe eigenstates $\\\\left|\\\\phi_n\\\\right\\\\rangle$\\nin turn have a simple time evolution:\\n\\n$$\\n    \\\\left|\\\\phi_n(t)\\\\right\\\\rangle=\\\\left|\\\\phi_n(0)\\\\right\\\\rangle\\\\cdot \\\\exp{-i E_nt/\\\\hbar}.\\n$$\\n\\nIf we know the initial state of a system\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\left|\\\\psi(0)\\\\right\\\\rangle=\\\\sum_n \\\\alpha_n\\\\left|\\\\phi_n\\\\right\\\\rangle,\\n$$\\n\\nwhere $\\\\alpha_n=\\\\langle\\\\phi_n | \\\\psi(0)\\\\rangle$, we will\\nknow the full dimension time evolution\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\left|\\\\psi(t)\\\\right\\\\rangle=\\\\sum_n\\\\alpha_n\\\\left|\\\\phi_n\\\\right\\\\rangle\\\\exp{-i E_n t/\\\\hbar}. \\\\;\\\\, \\\\text{(Schrödinger picture)}\\n$$\\n\\n**Note.** Sometimes it is beneficial to work in the\\nHeisenberg picture, which works with static ket vectors\\n$\\\\left|\\\\psi\\\\right\\\\rangle^{(H)}$ and incorporates the time\\nevolution in the operators. [^1] In certain cases one would have to have\\naccess to relativistic dynamics, which are then described by the **Dirac\\nequation**. However, we will only touch on this topic very briefly, as\\nit directly leads us into the intruiging problems of **quantum\\nelectrodynamics**.\\n\\n## The Heisenberg picture\\n\\nAs mentionned in the first lecture it can benefitial to work in the\\nHeisenberg picture instead of the Schrödinger picture. This approach is\\nwidely used in the field of many-body physics, as it underlies the\\nformalism of the second quantization. To make the connection with the\\nSchrödinger picture we should remember that we have the formal solution\\nof\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\left|\\\\psi(t)\\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\mathrm{e}^{-i\\\\hat{H}t}\\\\left|\\\\psi(0)\\\\right\\\\rangle\\n$$\\n\\nSo, if we would like to look into the expectation value\\nof some operator, we have:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\langle\\\\hat{A}(t)\\\\rangle = \\\\left\\\\langle\\\\psi(0)\\\\right|\\\\mathrm{e}^{i\\\\hat{H}t}\\\\hat{A}_S\\\\mathrm{e}^{-i\\\\hat{H}t}\\\\left|\\\\psi(0)\\\\right\\\\rangle\\n$$\\n\\nThis motivates the following definition of the operator\\nin the Heisenberg picture:\\n\\n$$\\n    \\\\hat{A}_H=\\\\mathrm{e}^{i{\\\\hat{H} t}/{\\\\hbar}} \\\\hat{A}_S \\\\mathrm{e}^{-i{\\\\hat{H} t}/{\\\\hbar}}\\n$$\\n\\nwhere $\\\\exp{-i{\\\\hat{H} t}/{\\\\hbar}}$ is a time evolution\\noperator (N.B.: $\\\\hat{H}_S = \\\\hat{H}_H$). The time evolution of\\n$\\\\hat{A}_H$ is:\\n\\n$$\\n    \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\hat{A}_H = \\\\frac{i}{\\\\hbar}\\\\hat{H}\\\\mathrm{e}^{i{\\\\hat{H}t}/{\\\\hbar}}\\\\hat{A}_S \\\\mathrm{e}^{-i{\\\\hat{H} t}/{\\\\hbar}}\\\\\\\\\\n    -\\\\frac{i}{\\\\hbar} \\\\mathrm{e}^{i{\\\\hat{H} t}/{\\\\hbar}}\\\\hat{A}_S \\\\mathrm{e}^{-i{\\\\hat{H}t}/{\\\\hbar}}\\\\hat{H}+\\\\partial_t \\\\hat{A}_H\\\\\\\\\\n    = \\\\frac{i}{\\\\hbar}\\\\left[\\\\hat{H},\\\\hat{A}_H\\\\right] + \\\\mathrm{e}^{i{\\\\hat{H}t}/{\\\\hbar}}\\\\partial_t\\\\hat{A}_S\\\\mathrm{e}^{-i{\\\\hat{H}t}/{\\\\hbar}}\\n$$\\n\\n**Note.** In the Heisenberg picture the state vectors\\nare time-independent:\\n\\n$$\\n    \\\\left|\\\\psi\\\\right\\\\rangle_H \\\\equiv \\\\left|\\\\psi(t=0)\\\\right\\\\rangle=\\\\exp{i{\\\\hat{H}}t/{\\\\hbar}} \\\\left|\\\\psi(t)\\\\right\\\\rangle.\\n$$\\n\\nTherefore, the results of measurements are the same in\\nboth pictures:\\n\\n$$\\n \\\\left\\\\langle\\\\psi(t)\\\\right|\\\\hat{A}\\\\left|\\\\psi(t)\\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\left\\\\langle\\\\psi\\\\right|_H \\\\hat{A}_H \\\\left|\\\\psi\\\\right\\\\rangle_H.\\n$$\\n\\n[^1]:\\n    We will follow this route in the discussion of the two-level\\n    system and the Bloch sphere.\\n\\n[^2002]: Dalibard Basdevant.

We will finish this discussion today and then\\nintroduce the most important consequences. We will continue to closely\\nfollow the discussion of the introductory chapter of Ref. [^2006]\\n\\n## Composite systems\\n\\nIt is actually quite rare that we can label the system with a single\\nquantum number. Any atom will involve spin, position, angular momentum.\\nOther examples might just involve two spin which we observe. So the\\nquestion is then on how we label those systems. We then have two\\nquestions to answer:\\n\\n1.  How many labels do we need for a system to fully determine its\\n    quantum state ?\\n\\n2.  Once I know all the labels, how do I construct the full state out of\\n    them ?\\n\\nWe will actually discuss the second question first as it sets the\\nnotation for the first question.\\n\\n### Entangled States\\n\\nIn AMO we typically would like to characterize is the state of an\\nelectron in a hydrogen atom. We need to define its angular momentum\\nlabel $L$, which might be 0, 1, 2 and also its electron spin $S$, which\\nmight be $\\\\{\\\\uparrow, \\\\downarrow\\\\}$. It state is then typically labelled\\nas something like\\n\\n$$\\\\left|L=0, S=\\\\uparrow\\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\left|0,\\\\uparrow\\\\right\\\\rangle$$\\n\\netc.\\n\\nAnother, simple example is that of two spins, each one having two\\npossible states $\\\\{\\\\uparrow, \\\\downarrow\\\\}$. This is a standard problem\\nin optical communication, where you send correlated photons with a\\ncertain polarization to different people. We will typically call them\\nAlice and Bob [^1].\\n\\nWe now would like to understand than if we can disentangle the\\ninformation about the different labels. Naively, we can now associate\\nwith Alice one set of outcomes and describe it by some state\\n$\\\\left|\\\\psi_{A}\\\\right\\\\rangle$ and the Bob has another set\\n$\\\\left|\\\\psi_{B}\\\\right\\\\rangle$:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\left|\\\\psi_A\\\\right\\\\rangle= a_{\\\\uparrow} \\\\left|\\\\uparrow_A\\\\right\\\\rangle+ a_{\\\\downarrow} \\\\left|\\\\downarrow_A\\\\right\\\\rangle\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\left|\\\\psi_B\\\\right\\\\rangle= b_{\\\\uparrow} \\\\left|\\\\uparrow_B\\\\right\\\\rangle+ b_{\\\\downarrow} \\\\left|\\\\downarrow_B\\\\right\\\\rangle\\n$$\\n\\nThe full state will then be described by the possible outcomes\\n$\\\\{\\\\uparrow_A\\\\uparrow_B,\\\\downarrow_A\\\\uparrow_B,\\\\uparrow_A\\\\downarrow_B, \\\\downarrow_A\\\\downarrow_B\\\\}$.\\nWe can then write:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\left|\\\\psi\\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\alpha_{\\\\uparrow\\\\uparrow}(\\\\left|\\\\uparrow_A\\\\right\\\\rangle\\\\otimes\\\\left|\\\\uparrow_B\\\\right\\\\rangle)+\\\\alpha_{\\\\uparrow\\\\downarrow}(\\\\left|\\\\uparrow_A\\\\right\\\\rangle\\\\otimes\\\\left|\\\\downarrow_B\\\\right\\\\rangle)+\\\\alpha_{\\\\downarrow\\\\uparrow}(\\\\left|\\\\downarrow_A\\\\right\\\\rangle\\\\otimes\\\\left|\\\\uparrow_B\\\\right\\\\rangle)+\\\\alpha_{\\\\downarrow\\\\downarrow}(\\\\left|\\\\downarrow_A\\\\right\\\\rangle\\\\otimes\\\\left|\\\\downarrow_B\\\\right\\\\rangle)\\\\\\\\\\n= \\\\alpha_{\\\\uparrow\\\\uparrow}\\\\left|\\\\uparrow\\\\uparrow\\\\right\\\\rangle+\\\\alpha_{\\\\uparrow\\\\downarrow}\\\\left|\\\\uparrow\\\\downarrow\\\\right\\\\rangle+\\\\alpha_{\\\\downarrow\\\\uparrow}\\\\left|\\\\downarrow \\\\uparrow\\\\right\\\\rangle+\\\\alpha_{\\\\downarrow\\\\downarrow}\\\\left|\\\\downarrow\\\\downarrow\\\\right\\\\rangle\\n$$\\n\\nSo we will typically just plug the labels into a single\\nket and drop indices, to avoid rewriting the tensor symbol each time. We\\nsay that a state is _separable_, if we can write it as a product of the\\ntwo individual states as above:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\left|\\\\psi\\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\left|\\\\psi_A\\\\right\\\\rangle\\\\otimes\\\\left|\\\\psi_B\\\\right\\\\rangle\\\\\\\\\\n=a_{\\\\uparrow} b_\\\\uparrow \\\\left|\\\\uparrow\\\\uparrow\\\\right\\\\rangle+a_{\\\\downarrow} b_\\\\uparrow \\\\left|\\\\downarrow\\\\uparrow\\\\right\\\\rangle+a_{\\\\uparrow} b_\\\\downarrow \\\\left|\\\\uparrow\\\\downarrow\\\\right\\\\rangle+a_{\\\\downarrow} b_\\\\downarrow \\\\left|\\\\downarrow\\\\downarrow\\\\right\\\\rangle\\n$$\\n\\nAll other states are called _entangled_. The most famous entangled\\nstates are the Bell states:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\left|\\\\psi_\\\\textrm{Bell}\\\\right\\\\rangle=\\\\frac{\\\\left|\\\\uparrow\\\\uparrow\\\\right\\\\rangle+\\\\left|\\\\downarrow\\\\downarrow\\\\right\\\\rangle}{\\\\sqrt{2}}\\n$$\\n\\nIn general we will say that the quantum system is formed by two\\nsubsystems $S_1$ and $S_2$. If they are independent we can write each of\\nthem as:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\left|\\\\psi_1\\\\right\\\\rangle=\\\\sum_m^M a_m \\\\left|\\\\alpha_m\\\\right\\\\rangle,\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\left|\\\\psi_2\\\\right\\\\rangle=\\\\sum_n^N b_n \\\\left|\\\\beta_n\\\\right\\\\rangle.\\n$$\\n\\nIn general we will then write:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\left|\\\\psi\\\\right\\\\rangle=\\\\sum_m^M \\\\sum_n^N c_{mn}(\\\\left|\\\\alpha_m\\\\right\\\\rangle\\\\otimes \\\\left|\\\\beta_n\\\\right\\\\rangle).\\n$$\\n\\nSo we can determine such a state by $M \\\\times N$ numbers\\n$c_{mn}$ here. If the states are _separable_, we can write\\n$\\\\left|\\\\psi\\\\right\\\\rangle$ as a product of the individual\\nstates:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\left|\\\\psi\\\\right\\\\rangle=\\\\left|\\\\psi_1\\\\right\\\\rangle\\\\otimes\\\\left|\\\\psi_2\\\\right\\\\rangle=\\\\left(\\\\sum_m^M a_m \\\\left|\\\\alpha_m\\\\right\\\\rangle\\\\right) \\\\otimes \\\\left(\\\\sum_n^N b_n \\\\left|\\\\beta_n\\\\right\\\\rangle\\\\right)\\n$$\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\left|\\\\psi\\\\right\\\\rangle=\\\\sum_m^M \\\\sum_n^N a_m b_n \\\\left|\\\\alpha_m\\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\otimes \\\\left|\\\\beta_n\\\\right\\\\rangle.\\n$$\\n\\nSeparable states thus only describes a small subset of all possible\\nstates.\\n\\n## Statistical Mixtures and Density Operator\\n\\nHaving set up the formalism for writing down the full quantum state with\\nplenty of labels, we have to solve the next problem. As an\\nexperimentalist, you will rarely measure all of them. This means that\\nyou only perform a partial measurement and you have only partial\\ninformation of the system. The extreme case is the thermodynamic\\nensemble, where we measure only temperature to describe $10^{23}$\\nparticles.\\n\\nA similiar problem arises for Alice and Bob. They typically measure the\\nstate of the qubit in their lab without knowing what the other did. So\\nthey need some way to describe the system locally. This is done through\\nthe density operator approach.\\n\\nIn the density operator approach the state of the system is described by\\na Hermitian density operator\\n\\n$$\\n \\\\hat{\\\\rho} = \\\\sum_{n=1}^N p_n \\\\left|\\\\phi_n\\\\right\\\\rangle\\\\left\\\\langle\\\\phi_n\\\\right|.\\n$$\\n\\nHere, $\\\\left\\\\langle\\\\phi_n\\\\right|$ are the\\neigenstates of $\\\\hat{\\\\rho}$, and $p_n$ are the probabilities to find the\\nsystem in the respective states\\n$\\\\left|\\\\phi_n\\\\right\\\\rangle$. The trace of the density\\noperator is the sum of all probabilities $p_n$:\\n\\n$$\\n  \\\\mathrm{tr}(\\\\hat{\\\\rho}) = \\\\sum p_n = 1.\\n$$\\n\\nFor a pure state $\\\\left|\\\\psi\\\\right\\\\rangle$, we get $p_n=1$\\nfor only one value of $n$. For every other $n$, the probabilities\\nvanish. We thus obtain a \\"pure\\" density operator\\n$\\\\hat{\\\\rho}_{\\\\text{pure}}$ which has the properties of a projection\\noperator:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\hat{\\\\rho}_{\\\\text{pure}} = \\\\left|\\\\psi\\\\right\\\\rangle\\\\left\\\\langle\\\\psi\\\\right| \\\\qquad \\\\Longleftrightarrow \\\\qquad \\\\hat{\\\\rho}^2 = \\\\hat{\\\\rho}.\\n$$\\n\\nFor the simple qubit we then have:\\n\\n$$\\n  \\\\hat{\\\\rho}= \\\\left(\\\\alpha_\\\\uparrow\\\\left|\\\\uparrow\\\\right\\\\rangle+\\\\alpha_\\\\downarrow\\\\left|\\\\downarrow\\\\right\\\\rangle\\\\right)\\\\left(\\\\alpha_\\\\uparrow^*\\\\left\\\\langle\\\\uparrow\\\\right|+\\\\alpha_\\\\downarrow^*\\\\left\\\\langle\\\\downarrow\\\\right|\\\\right)\\\\\\\\\\n  = |\\\\alpha_\\\\uparrow|^2\\\\left|\\\\uparrow\\\\right\\\\rangle\\\\left\\\\langle\\\\uparrow\\\\right|+|\\\\alpha_\\\\downarrow|^2\\\\left|\\\\downarrow\\\\right\\\\rangle\\\\left\\\\langle\\\\downarrow\\\\right|+\\\\alpha_\\\\downarrow\\\\alpha_\\\\uparrow^*\\\\left|\\\\downarrow\\\\right\\\\rangle\\\\left\\\\langle\\\\uparrow\\\\right|+\\\\alpha_\\\\uparrow\\\\alpha_\\\\downarrow^*\\\\left|\\\\uparrow\\\\right\\\\rangle\\\\left\\\\langle\\\\downarrow\\\\right|\\n$$\\n\\nThen it is even simpler to write in matrix form:\\n\\n$$\\n  \\\\hat{\\\\rho}= \\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{cc}\\n  |\\\\alpha_\\\\uparrow|^2&\\\\alpha_\\\\uparrow\\\\alpha_\\\\downarrow^*\\\\\\\\\\n  \\\\alpha_\\\\downarrow\\\\alpha_\\\\uparrow^*&|\\\\alpha_\\\\downarrow|^2\\n  \\\\end{array}\\\\right)\\n$$\\n\\nFor a thermal state on the other hand we have:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\hat{\\\\rho}_{\\\\text{thermal}} = \\\\sum_{n=1}^N \\\\frac{e^{-\\\\frac{E_n}{k_BT}}}{Z} \\\\left|\\\\phi_n\\\\right\\\\rangle\\\\left\\\\langle\\\\phi_n\\\\right|\\\\text{ with }Z = \\\\sum_{n=1}^N e^{-\\\\frac{E_n}{k_BT}}\\n$$\\n\\nWith this knowledge we can now determine the result of a\\nmeasurement of an observable $A$ belonging to an operator $\\\\hat{A}$. For\\nthe pure state $\\\\left|\\\\psi\\\\right\\\\rangle$ we get:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\langle \\\\hat{A}\\\\rangle = \\\\left\\\\langle\\\\psi\\\\right| \\\\hat{A} \\\\left|\\\\psi\\\\right\\\\rangle.\\n$$\\n\\nFor a mixed state we get:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\langle \\\\hat{A}\\\\rangle = \\\\mathrm{tr}(\\\\hat{\\\\rho}\\\\cdot \\\\hat{A}) = \\\\sum_n {p_n} \\\\left\\\\langle\\\\phi_n\\\\right| \\\\hat{A} \\\\left|\\\\phi_n\\\\right\\\\rangle.\\n$$\\n\\nThe time evolution of the density operator can be\\nexpressed with the von Neumann equation:\\n\\n$$\\ni\\\\hbar \\\\partial_{t}\\\\hat{\\\\rho}(t) = [\\\\hat{H}(t),\\\\hat{\\\\rho}(t)].\\n$$\\n\\n### Back to partial measurements\\n\\nWe can now come back to the correlated photons sent to Alice and Bob,\\nsharing a Bell pair. They full density matrix is then especially simple:\\n\\n$$\\n  \\\\hat{\\\\rho}= \\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{cccc}\\n  \\\\frac{1}{2}& 0& 0 &\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\\\\\\\n  0 & 0 & 0& 0\\\\\\\\\\n  0&0&0&0\\\\\\\\\\n    \\\\frac{1}{2}&0&0&\\\\frac{1}{2}\\n  \\\\end{array}\\\\right)\\n$$\\n\\nLet us write the system as $S = S_A \\\\otimes S_B$.

The eigenstates can be expressed in matrix\\nnotation:\\n\\n$$\\n \\\\left|0\\\\right\\\\rangle=\\\\left( \\\\begin{array}{c} 1 \\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\end{array} \\\\right), \\\\qquad \\\\left|1\\\\right\\\\rangle=\\\\left( \\\\begin{array}{c} 0 \\\\\\\\ 1 \\\\end{array} \\\\right),\\n$$\\n\\nso that $\\\\hat{H}_0$ be written as a diagonal matrix\\n\\n$$\\n    \\\\hat{H}_0 = \\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{cc} E_0 & 0 \\\\\\\\ 0 & E_1 \\\\end{array}\\\\right).\\n$$\\n\\nIf we would only prepare eigenstates the system would be\\nrather boring. However, we typically have the ability to change the\\nHamiltonian by switching on and off laser or microwave fields [^1]. We\\ncan then write the Hamiltonian in its most general form as:\\n\\n$$\\n\\n\\\\hat{H} = \\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{2}\\\\left( \\\\begin{array}{cc} \\\\Delta  & \\\\Omega_x - i\\\\Omega_y\\\\\\\\ \\\\Omega_x +i\\\\Omega_y & -\\\\Delta \\\\end{array} \\\\right)\\n$$\\n\\nSometimes we will also chose the definition:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\Omega = |\\\\Omega| e^{i\\\\varphi}=\\\\Omega_x + i\\\\Omega_y\\n$$\\n\\nIt is particularly useful for the case in which the\\ncoupling is created by a laser. Another useful way of thinking about the\\ntwo-level system is as a spin in a magnetic field. Let us remind us of\\nthe definitions of the of the spin-1/2 matrices:\\n\\n$$\\ns_x = \\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{2}\\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{cc}\\n0 & 1\\\\\\\\\\n1 &  0\\n\\\\end{array}\\n\\\\right)~\\ns_y = \\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{2}\\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{cc}\\n0 & -i\\\\\\\\\\ni &  0\\n\\\\end{array}\\n\\\\right)~s_z =\\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{2} \\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{cc}\\n1 & 0\\\\\\\\\\n0 &  -1\\n\\\\end{array}\\n\\\\right)\\n$$\\n\\nWe then obtain:\\n\\n$$\\n\\n\\\\hat{H} = \\\\mathbf{B}\\\\cdot\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{s}}\\\\text{ with }\\\\mathbf{B} = (\\\\Omega_x, \\\\Omega_y, \\\\Delta)\\n$$\\n\\nYou will go through this calculation in the excercise of\\nthis week.\\n\\n### Case of no perturbation $\\\\Omega = 0$\\n\\nThis is exactly the case of no applied laser fields that we discussed\\npreviously. We simply removed the energy offset\\n$E_m = \\\\frac{E_0+E_1}{2}$ and pulled out the factor $\\\\hbar$, such that\\n$\\\\Delta$ measures a frequency. So we have:\\n\\n$$\\nE_0 = E_m+ \\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{2}\\\\Delta\\\\\\\\\\nE_1 = E_m- \\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{2}\\\\Delta\\n$$\\n\\nWe typically call $\\\\Delta$ the energy difference between\\nthe levels or the **detuning**.\\n\\n### Case of no detuning $\\\\Delta = 0$\\n\\nLet us suppose that the diagonal elements are exactly zero. And for\\nsimplicity we will also keep $\\\\Omega_y =0$ as it simply complicates the\\ncalculations without adding much to the discussion at this stage. The\\nHamiltonian reads then:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\hat{H} = \\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{2}\\\\left( \\\\begin{array}{cc} 0  & \\\\Omega\\\\\\\\ \\\\Omega &0 \\\\end{array} \\\\right)\\n$$\\n\\nQuite clearly the states $\\\\varphi_{1,2}$ are not the eigenstates of the\\nsystem anymore. How should the system be described now ? We can once\\nagain diagonalize the system and write\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\hat{H}\\\\left|\\\\varphi_{\\\\pm}\\\\right\\\\rangle = E_{\\\\pm}\\\\left|\\\\varphi_\\\\pm\\\\right\\\\rangle\\\\\\\\\\nE_{\\\\pm} = \\\\pm\\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{2}\\\\Omega\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\left|\\\\varphi_\\\\pm\\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\frac{\\\\left|0\\\\right\\\\rangle\\\\pm\\\\left|1\\\\right\\\\rangle}{\\\\sqrt{2}}\\n$$\\n\\nTwo important consequences can be understood from this\\nresult:\\n\\n1.  The coupling of the two states shifts their energy by $\\\\Omega$. This\\n    is the idea of level repulsion.\\n\\n2.  The coupled states are a superposition of the initial states.\\n\\nThis is also a motivation the formulation of the 'bare' system for\\n$\\\\Omega = 0$ and the 'dressed' states for the coupled system.\\n\\n### General case\\n\\nQuite importantly we can solve the system completely even in the general\\ncase. By diagonalizing the Hamiltonian we obtain:\\n\\n$$\\n E_\\\\pm = \\\\pm \\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{2} \\\\sqrt{\\\\Delta^2+|\\\\Omega|^2}\\n$$\\n\\nThe energies can be nicely summarized as in Fig.\\n\\n<img src=\\"./lecture3_pic2.png\\" width=\\"90%\\">\\n\\nThe Eigenstates then read:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\left|\\\\psi_+\\\\right\\\\rangle=\\\\cos\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}\\\\right) \\\\mathrm{e}^{-i{\\\\varphi}/{2}}\\\\left|0\\\\right\\\\rangle+\\\\sin\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}\\\\right) \\\\mathrm{e}^{i{\\\\varphi}/{2}}\\\\left|1\\\\right\\\\rangle,\\n$$\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\left|\\\\psi_-\\\\right\\\\rangle=-\\\\sin\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}\\\\right) \\\\mathrm{e}^{-i{\\\\varphi}/{2}}\\\\left|0\\\\right\\\\rangle+\\\\cos\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}\\\\right) \\\\mathrm{e}^{i{\\\\varphi}/{2}}\\\\left|1\\\\right\\\\rangle,\\n$$\\n\\nwhere\\n\\n$$\\n\\n\\\\tan(\\\\theta) = \\\\frac{|\\\\Omega|}{\\\\Delta}\\n$$\\n\\n## The Bloch sphere\\n\\nWhile we could just discuss the details of the above state in the\\nabstract, it is extremely helpful to visualize the problem on the Bloch\\nsphere. The idea of the Bloch sphere is that the we have a complex wave\\nfunction of well defined norm and two free parameters. So it seems quite\\nnatural to look for a good representation of it. And this is the Bloch\\nsphere as drawn below\\n\\n<img src=\\"./lecture3_pic3.png\\" width=\\"90%\\">\\n\\nWe will see especially its usefulness especially as we discuss the\\ndynamics of the two-state system.\\n\\n## Dynamical Aspects\\n\\n### Time Evolution of $\\\\left|\\\\psi(t)\\\\right\\\\rangle$\\n\\nAfter the static case we now want to investigate the dynamical\\nproperties of the two-state system. We calculate the time evolution of\\n$\\\\left|\\\\psi(t)\\\\right\\\\rangle = c_0(t)\\\\left|0\\\\right\\\\rangle + c_1(t)\\\\left|1\\\\right\\\\rangle$\\nwith the Schrödinger equation and the perturbed Hamiltonian:\\n\\n$$\\ni\\\\hbar \\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\left|\\\\psi(t)\\\\right\\\\rangle=\\\\hat{H}\\\\left|\\\\psi(t)\\\\right\\\\rangle,\\\\\\\\\\ni \\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{c} c_0(t) \\\\\\\\ c_1(t) \\\\end{array}\\\\right) = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left( \\\\begin{array}{cc} \\\\Delta & \\\\Omega \\\\\\\\ \\\\Omega^* & -\\\\Delta \\\\end{array} \\\\right) \\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{c} c_0(t) \\\\\\\\ c_1(t) \\\\end{array} \\\\right).\\n$$\\n\\nWe have two coupled differential equations and we luckily already know\\nhow to solve them as we have calculated the two eigenenergies in the\\nprevious section. For the state\\n$\\\\left|\\\\psi(t)\\\\right\\\\rangle$ we get\\n\\n$$\\n \\\\left|\\\\psi(t)\\\\right\\\\rangle=\\\\lambda \\\\mathrm{e}^{-i{E_+}t/{\\\\hbar}} \\\\left|\\\\psi_+\\\\right\\\\rangle + \\\\mu \\\\mathrm{e}^{-i{E_-}t/{\\\\hbar}} \\\\left|\\\\psi_-\\\\right\\\\rangle\\n$$\\n\\nwith the factors $\\\\lambda$ and $\\\\mu$, which are defined\\nby the initial state. The most common question is then what happens to\\nthe system if we start out in the bare state\\n$\\\\left|0\\\\right\\\\rangle$ and then let it evolve under\\ncoupling with a laser ? So what is the probability to find it in the\\nother state $\\\\left|1\\\\right\\\\rangle$:\\n\\n$$\\nP_1(t)=\\\\left|\\\\left\\\\langle 1|\\\\psi(t)\\\\right\\\\rangle\\\\right|^2.\\n$$\\n\\nAs a first step, we have to apply the initial condition\\nto and express\\n$\\\\left|\\\\varphi\\\\right\\\\rangle$ in terms of $|\\\\psi_+$ and $|\\\\psi_-$:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\left|\\\\psi(0)\\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\overset{!}{=} \\\\left|0\\\\right\\\\rangle\\\\\\\\\\n  = \\\\mathrm{e}^{i{\\\\varphi}/{2}} \\\\left[ \\\\cos\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}\\\\right) \\\\left|\\\\psi_+\\\\right\\\\rangle-\\\\sin\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}\\\\right)\\\\left|\\\\psi_-\\\\right\\\\rangle\\\\right]\\n$$\\n\\nBy equating the coefficients we get for $\\\\lambda$ and\\n$\\\\mu$:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\lambda = \\\\mathrm{e}^{i{\\\\varphi}/{2}}\\\\cos\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}\\\\right), \\\\qquad  \\\\mu = -\\\\mathrm{e}^{i{\\\\varphi}/{2}}\\\\sin\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}\\\\right).\\n$$\\n\\nOne thus gets:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\hspace{-2mm} P_1(t)=\\\\left|\\\\left\\\\langle 1|\\\\psi(t)\\\\right\\\\rangle\\\\right|^2 \\\\\\\\\\n= \\\\left|\\\\mathrm{e}^{i\\\\varphi} \\\\sin\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}\\\\right)\\\\cos\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}\\\\right)\\\\left[\\\\mathrm{e}^{-i{E_+}t/{\\\\hbar}} - \\\\mathrm{e}^{-i{E_-}t/{\\\\hbar}}\\\\right]\\\\right|^2\\\\\\\\\\n= \\\\sin^2(\\\\theta)\\\\sin^2\\\\left(\\\\frac{E_+-E_-}{2\\\\hbar}t\\\\right)\\n$$\\n\\n$P_1(t)$ can be expressed with $\\\\Delta$ and $\\\\Omega$\\nalone.

They become actually quite transparent in\\nthe spin language and on the Bloch sphere. So let us go back to the\\nformulation of the Hamiltonian in terms of spins as at the beginning of the lecture.\\n\\nHow would the question of the time evolution from $0$ to $1$ and back go\\nnow ? Basically, we would assume that the spin has been initialize into\\none of the eigenstates of the $z$-basis and now starts to rotate in some\\nmagnetic field. How ? This can be nicely studied in the Heisenberg\\npicture, where operators have a time evolution. In the Heisenberg\\npicture we have:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\hat{s}_i = \\\\frac{i}{\\\\hbar}\\\\left[\\\\hat{H},\\\\hat{s}_i\\\\right]\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\hat{s}_i = \\\\frac{i}{\\\\hbar}\\\\sum_j B_j \\\\left[\\\\hat{s}_j,\\\\hat{s}_i\\\\right]\\\\\\\\\\n\\n\\n$$\\n\\nSo to understand we time evolution, we only need to\\nemploy the commutator relationships between the spins:\\n\\n$$\\n= \\\\hbar is_z~~[ s_y, s_z] = \\\\hbar is_x~~[ s_z, s_x] = \\\\hbar is_y\\n$$\\n\\nFor the specific case of $B_x=\\\\Omega$, $B_y = B_z = 0$,\\nwe have then:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\hat{s}_x = 0\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\hat{s}_y = -\\\\Omega \\\\hat{s}_z\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\hat{s}_z = \\\\Omega \\\\hat{s}_y\\n\\n\\n$$\\n\\nSo applying a field in x-direction leads to a rotation of the spin\\naround the $x$ axis with velocity $\\\\Omega$. We can now use this general\\npicture to understand the dynamics as rotations around an axis, which is\\ndefined by the different components of the magnetic field.\\n\\n## A few words on the quantum information notation\\n\\nThe qubit is THE basic ingredient of quantum computers. A nice way to\\nplay around with them is actually the [IBM Quantum\\nexperience](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/). However, you will\\ntypically not find Pauli matrices etc within these systems. The typical\\nnotation there is:\\n\\n- $R_x(\\\\phi)$ is a rotation around the x-axis for an angle $\\\\phi$.\\n\\n- Same holds for $R_y$ and $R_z$.\\n\\n- $X$ denotes the rotation around the x axis for an angle $\\\\pi$. So it\\n  transforms $\\\\left|1\\\\right\\\\rangle$ into\\n  $\\\\left|0\\\\right\\\\rangle$ and vise versa.\\n\\n- $Z$ denotes the rotation around the x axis for an angle $\\\\pi$. So it\\n  transforms $\\\\left|+\\\\right\\\\rangle$ into\\n  $\\\\left|-\\\\right\\\\rangle$ and vise versa.\\n\\nThe most commonly used gate is actually one that we did not talk about\\nat all, it is the _Hadamard_ gate, which transforms\\n$\\\\left|1\\\\right\\\\rangle$ into\\n$\\\\left|-\\\\right\\\\rangle$ and\\n$\\\\left|0\\\\right\\\\rangle$ into\\n$\\\\left|+\\\\right\\\\rangle$:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\hat{H}\\\\left|1\\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\left|-\\\\right\\\\rangle  ~   \\\\hat{H}\\\\left|0\\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\left|+\\\\right\\\\rangle\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\hat{H}\\\\left|-\\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\left|1\\\\right\\\\rangle  ~   \\\\hat{H}\\\\left|+\\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\left|0\\\\right\\\\rangle\\n$$\\n\\nIn the forth lecture we will see how it is that a time-dependent field can actually couple two atomic states, which are normally of very different energies.\\n\\n[^1]: See the discussions of the next lecture\\n\\n[^CT1]: Quantum Mechanics, Volume 1.

It is exactly this\\n  effect, which allows us to isolate specific transitions to a very\\n  high degree [^1]\\n\\nWe will now see how the two-state system emerges from these\\napproximations and then set-up the perturbative treatment step-by-step.\\n\\n## Rotating wave approximation\\n\\nWe will now assume that the coupling term in indeed an oscillating field\\nwith frequency $\\\\omega_L$, so it reads:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\hat{V} = \\\\hat{V}_0 \\\\cos(\\\\omega_Lt) = \\\\frac{\\\\hat{V}_0}{2} \\\\left(e^{i\\\\omega_lt}+e^{-i\\\\omega_lt}\\\\right)\\n$$\\n\\nWe will further assume the we would like use it to\\nisolate the transition $i\\\\rightarrow f$, which is of frequency\\n$\\\\hbar \\\\omega_0 = E_f - E_i$. The relevant quantity is then the detuning\\n$\\\\delta = \\\\omega_0 - \\\\omega_L$. If it is much smaller than any other\\nenergy difference $E_n-E_i$, we directly reduce the system to the\\nfollowing closed system:\\n\\n$$\\ni\\\\dot{\\\\gamma}_i = \\\\gamma_f \\\\mathrm{e}^{-i \\\\delta t} \\\\Omega\\\\\\\\\\ni\\\\dot{\\\\gamma}_f = \\\\gamma_i \\\\mathrm{e}^{i \\\\delta t}\\\\Omega^*\\n$$\\n\\nHere we defined\\n$\\\\Omega = \\\\left\\\\langle i\\\\right| \\\\frac{\\\\hat{V_0}}{2\\\\hbar}\\\\left|f\\\\right\\\\rangle$.\\nAnd to make it really a time-of the same form as the two-level system\\nfrom the last lecture, we perform the transformation\\n$\\\\gamma_f = \\\\tilde{\\\\gamma}_f e^{i\\\\delta t}$, which reduces the system\\ntoo:\\n\\n$$\\ni \\\\dot{\\\\gamma}_i = \\\\Omega \\\\tilde{\\\\gamma}_f \\\\\\\\\\ni\\\\dot{\\\\tilde{\\\\gamma}}_f = \\\\delta \\\\tilde{\\\\gamma}_f + \\\\Omega^* \\\\gamma_i\\n$$\\n\\nThis has exactly the form of the two-level system that\\nwe studied previously.\\n\\n### Adiabatic elimination\\n\\nWe can now proceed to the quite important case of far detuning, where\\n$\\\\delta \\\\gg \\\\Omega$.

It is visualized below\\n\\n<img src=\\"./lecture7_pic1.png\\" width=\\"70%\\">\\n\\nThe Zeeman effect in the hydrogen atom.\\n\\n## Trapping with electric or magnetic fields\\n\\nWe have now investigated the structure of the hydrogen atom and seen how\\nits energy gets shifted in external magnetic fields. We can combine this\\nunderstanding to study conservative traps for atoms and ions. Neutral\\natoms experience the external field:\\n\\n$$\\nE_{mag}(x,y) = \\\\mu_B m B_0(x,y)\\n$$\\n\\nFor ions on the other hand we have fully charged\\nparticles. So they simply experience the external electric field\\ndirectly:\\n\\n$$\\nE_{el}(x,y) = -q E(x,y)\\n$$\\n\\nTrapping atoms and ions has to be done under very good vacuum such that\\nthey are well isolate from the enviromnent and high precision\\nexperiments can be performed.\\n\\nHowever, the trap construction is not trivial given Maxwells equation\\n$\\\\text{div} \\\\vec{E} = 0$ and $\\\\text{div} \\\\vec{B} = 0$. So, the\\nexperimentalists have to play some tricks with oscillating fields. We\\nwill not derive in detail how a resulting **Paul trap** works, but the\\n[linked video](https://youtu.be/Xb-zpM0UOzk) gives a very nice\\nimpression of the idea behind it. A sketch is presented in Fig.\\n\\n<img src=\\"./lecture7_pic2.png\\" width=\\"70%\\">\\n\\nThe upper stage shows the phases of The two phases of the oscillating\\nelectric field of a Paul trap.

They shared\\nthe prize with Norman Ramsey, who developped extremely precise\\nspectroscopic methods, now known [as Ramsey spectroscopy](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/revmodphys.62.541).\\n\\nFor atoms we can play similiar games with magnetic traps. Again we have\\nto solve the problem of the zero magnetic fields. Widely used\\nconfigurations are the Ioffe-Pritchard trap, where quadrupole fields are\\nsuperposed [with a bias field](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/physrevlett.51.1336), or [TOP-traps](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/physrevlett.74.3352).\\n\\nIon traps are now the basis of ionic quantum computers and\\nmagnetic traps paved the way for quantum simulators with cold atoms as will see later on.\\n\\n### What we missed from the Dirac equation\\n\\nUntil now we have completely neglected relativistic effects, i.e. we\\nshould have really solved the Dirac equation instead of the Schrödinger\\nequation. However, this is is major task, which we will not undertake\\nhere. But what were the main approximations ?\\n\\n1.  We neglected the existance of the electron spin.\\n\\n2.  We did not take into account the relativistic effects.\\n\\nSo, how does relativity affect the hydrogen spectrum? In a first step,\\nwe should actually introduce the magnetic moment of the spin:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\vec{M}_S = -g_e \\\\mu_B \\\\frac{\\\\vec{S}}{\\\\hbar}\\n$$\\n\\nThe spin of the electron is $1/2$, making it a fermion\\nand the _g factor of the electron_ reads\\n\\n$$\\ng_e \\\\approx 2.0023\\n$$\\n\\nFurther discussions of the g-factor might be found in\\n[Chapter 6.6 of Hertel](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-54322-7).\\n\\n#### Amplitude of the relativistic effects\\n\\nWe saw in the previous lectures, that the\\nenergy levels of hydrogenlike atoms are given by:\\n\\n$$\\n\\nE_n = \\\\frac{Z^2 R_{y,\\\\infty}}{n^2}\\\\\\\\\\nR_{y,\\\\infty} = \\\\frac{m_e e^4}{32 \\\\pi^2 \\\\epsilon_0^2 \\\\hbar^2}\\n$$\\n\\nWe can now use the fine-structure constant, which\\nmeasures the coupling strength of the electric charges to the\\nelectromagnetic field:\\n\\n$$\\n\\n\\\\alpha = \\\\frac{e^2}{4\\\\pi\\\\epsilon_0\\\\hbar c}\\\\\\\\\\n= \\\\frac{1}{137.035999139(31)}\\n$$\\n\\nWe can now rewrite the energies of the hydrogen atom as:\\n\\n$$\\nE_n = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\underbrace{m_e c^2}_{\\\\text{rest mass energy}} Z^2 \\\\alpha^2 \\\\frac{1}{n^2}\\n$$\\n\\nHere, $m_e c^2\\\\approx 511\\\\textrm{k eV}$ is the rest\\nmass energy of the electron. $E_n \\\\approx 10\\\\text{eV}$ on the other hand\\nis the energy of the bound state and therefore in the order of the\\nkinetic energy of the electron. As long as it is much smaller than the\\nrest-mass of the electron, we can neglect the relativistic effects. A\\nfew observations:\\n\\n- Relativistic effects are most pronounced for deeply bound states of\\n  small quantum number $n$.\\n\\n- Relativistic effects effects will become important once\\n  $(Z\\\\alpha)\\\\approx 1$, so they will play a major role in heavy\\n  nuclei.\\n\\nFor the hydrogen atom we can thus treat the relativistic effects in a\\nperturbative approach.But the most important consequence of the\\nrelativistic terms is actually the existance of the electron spin.\\n\\n### The relativistic mass and Darwin term\\n\\n1.  \\"Relativistic mass\\": The relativistic relation between energy and\\n    momentum reads:\\n\\n$$\\n    E_\\\\text{rel} = \\\\sqrt{(mc^2)^2+(\\\\vec{p}c)^2}\\\\\\\\\\n    \\\\approx mc^2 + \\\\frac{p^2}{2m}- \\\\frac{\\\\vec{p}^{\\\\,4}}{8m^3c^2} + \\\\cdots\\n$$\\n\\nThe first two terms of the expansion are the\\nnonrelativistic limit and the third term is the first correction.\\nTherefore, the corresponding Hamiltonian is:\\n\\n$$\\n    \\\\hat{H}_\\\\text{rm} = - \\\\frac{\\\\hat{\\\\vec{p}}^{\\\\,4}}{8m^3c^2}.\\n$$\\n\\n2.

We have to include the spin degree of freedom into the\\ndescription. Let us repeat the same procedure for the spin projection:\\n\\n$$\\n= [S_z, L_x S_x + L_y S_y + L_z S_z]\\\\\\\\\\n[S_z, \\\\vec{L}\\\\cdot \\\\vec{S}] = L_x [S_z,  S_x] + L_y [S_z,  S_y]\\\\\\\\\\n[S_z, \\\\vec{L}\\\\cdot \\\\vec{S}] = i\\\\hbar L_x S_y -i\\\\hbar L_y S_x\\\\neq 0\\n$$\\n\\nThis implies that the spin projection is not a conserved\\nquantity either. However, the sum of spin and orbital angular momentum\\nwill commute $[L_z + S_z, \\\\vec{L}\\\\vec{S}] =0$ according to the above\\ncalculations. Similiar calculations hold for the other components,\\nindicating that the _total angular momentum_ is conserved [^2]:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\vec{J} = \\\\vec{L} + \\\\vec{S}\\n$$\\n\\nWe can now rewrite $\\\\hat{H}_{LS}$ in terms of the conserved quantities through the following following\\nlittle trick:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\hat{\\\\vec{J}}^2 = \\\\left( \\\\hat{\\\\vec{L}} + \\\\hat{\\\\vec{S}} \\\\right) ^2 = \\\\hat{\\\\vec{L}}^2 + 2 \\\\hat{\\\\vec{L}} \\\\cdot \\\\hat{\\\\vec{S}} + \\\\hat{\\\\vec{S}}^2\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\hat{\\\\vec{L}} \\\\cdot \\\\hat{\\\\vec{S}} = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left( \\\\hat{\\\\vec{J}}^2 - \\\\hat{\\\\vec{L}}^2 - \\\\hat{\\\\vec{S}}^2 \\\\right)\\n$$\\n\\nThis directly implies that $\\\\hat{J}^2$, $\\\\hat{L}^2$ and $\\\\hat{S}^2$ are\\nnew conserved quantities of the system. If we call $\\\\hat{H}_0$ the\\nHamiltonian of the hydrogen atom, we previously used the complete set of\\ncommuting observables [^3]:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\left\\\\{ \\\\hat{H}_0, \\\\hat{\\\\vec{L}}^2, \\\\hat{L}_z,\\\\hat{\\\\vec{S}}^2, \\\\hat{S}_z \\\\right\\\\}\\n$$\\n\\nWe now use the complete set of commuting observables:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\left\\\\{ \\\\hat{H}_0 + \\\\hat{H}_{LS}, \\\\hat{\\\\vec{L}}^2,\\\\hat{\\\\vec{S}}^2, \\\\hat{\\\\vec{J}}^2, \\\\hat{J}_z \\\\right\\\\}.\\n$$\\n\\nThe corresponding basis states\\n$\\\\left|n,l,j,m_j\\\\right\\\\rangle$ are given by:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\left|n,l,j,m_j\\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\sum_{m_l,m_s} \\\\left|n, l, m_l, m_s\\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\underbrace{\\\\left\\\\langle n, l, m_l, m_s | n, l, j, m_j\\\\right\\\\rangle}_{\\\\text{Clebsch-Gordan coefficients}}\\n$$\\n\\nHere, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients (cf.

Adapted from [Demtröder 2010 Fig. 5.33](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-10298-1)\\n\\n- The states should be characterized by angular momentum anymore, but\\n  by the total angular momentum $J$ and the orbital angular momentum.\\n  We introduce the notation:\\n\\n$$\\n    nl_{j}\\n$$\\n\\n- All shifts are on the order of $\\\\alpha^2$ and hence pertubative.\\n\\n- Some levels remain degenerate in relativistic theory, most\\n  importantly the $2s_{1/2}$ and the $2p_{1/2}$ state.\\n\\n## The Lamb shift\\n\\nThe previous discussions studied the effects of the Dirac equation onto\\nour understanding of the Hydrogen atom. Most importantly, we saw that we\\ncan test those predictions quite well through the shifts in the level\\nscheme. It is possible to push this analysis even further. One\\nparticularly important candidate here are the degenerate levels\\n$2s_{1/2}$ and $2p_{1/2}$. Being able to see any splitting here, will be\\nproof physics beyond the Dirac equation. And it is a relative\\nmeasurement, for which it therefore not necessary to have insane\\nabsolute precisions. It is exactly this measurement that [Lamb and\\nRetherford undertook in 1947](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/physrev.72.241). They observed actually a\\nsplitting of roughly $1$GHz, which they drove through direct\\nrf-transitions. The observed shift was immediately [explained by Bethe](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/physrev.72.339) through the idea of QED a concept that we will come back\\nto later in this lecture in a much simpler context of cavity QED.\\n\\nWe would simply like to add here that the long story of the hydrogen\\natom and the Lamb shift is far from over as open questions remained\\nuntil September 2019. Basically, a group of people measured the radius\\nin some 'heavy' muonic hydrogen very [precisely in 2010](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature09250).\\nThey could only explain them by changing the size of the proton radius,\\nwhich was previously assumed to be well measured. It was only this year\\nthe another team reperformed a similiar measurement on electronic\\nhydrogen (the normal one), [obtaining consistent results](http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.aau7807). A nice summary of the \\\\\\"proton radius puzzle\\\\\\" can be\\nfound [here](https://www.quantamagazine.org/physicists-finally-nail-the-protons-size-and-hope-dies-20190911/).\\n\\n## The helium problem\\n\\nIn this lecture we will discuss the Helium atom and what makes it so\\ninteresting in the laboratory. We will most importantly see that you\\ncannot solve the problem exactly. This makes it a great historical\\nexample where a simple system was used to test state-of-the-art\\ntheories. An extensive discussion can be found in Chapter 7 of Bransden [^Bransden] or [Chapter 6 of Demtröder 20210](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-10298-1). Even nowadays, the system continues to be a nice test-bed of many-body theories, see for example the paper by [Combescot in 2017](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/physrevx.7.041035) or by [Ott in 2019](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/physrevlett.123.203401)..\\n\\nThe Helium atom describes a two electron system as shown in the figure\\nbelow.\\n\\n<img src=\\"./lecture8_pic2.svg\\" width=\\"70%\\"/>\\n\\nThe helium atom describes two electrons coupled to the nucleus of\\ncharge Z=2.\\n\\nIn the reference frame of center-of-mass we obtain the following\\nHamiltonian:\\n$$H = -\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2\\\\mu}\\\\nabla_{r_1}^2 -\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2\\\\mu}\\\\nabla_{r_2}^2-\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{M}\\\\nabla_{r_1}\\\\cdot\\\\nabla_{r_2}+\\\\frac{e^2}{4\\\\pi \\\\epsilon_0}\\\\left(-\\\\frac{Z}{r_1}-\\\\frac{Z}{r_2}+\\\\frac{1}{r_{12}}\\\\right)$$\\n\\nThe term in the middle is the mass polarization term. We further\\nintroduced the reduced mass $$\\\\mu = \\\\frac{m_eM}{m_e + M}$$ For the very\\nlarge mass differences $M= 7300 m_e \\\\gg m_e$, we can do two\\nsimplifications:\\n\\n- Omit the term on the mass polarization.\\n\\n- Set the reduced mass to the mass of the electron.\\n\\nSo we obtain the simplified Hamiltonian\\n$$H = -\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m_e}\\\\nabla_{r_1}^2 -\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m_e}\\\\nabla_{r_2}^2+\\\\frac{e^2}{4\\\\pi \\\\epsilon_0}\\\\left(-\\\\frac{Z}{r_1}-\\\\frac{Z}{r_2}+\\\\frac{1}{r_{12}}\\\\right)$$\\n\\n## Natural units\\n\\nFor simplicity it is actually nice to work in the so-called **natural\\nunits**, where we measure all energies and distance on typical scales.\\nWe will start out by measuring all distances in units of $a_0$, which is\\ndefined as:\\n$$a_0 = \\\\frac{4\\\\pi \\\\epsilon_0 \\\\hbar^2}{me^2} = 0.5\\\\text{angstrom}$$ So\\nwe can introduce the replacement: $$\\\\mathbf{r} = \\\\mathbf{\\\\tilde{r}}a_0$$\\nSo the Hamiltonian reads:\\n\\n$$\\nH = -\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m_ea_0^2}\\\\nabla_{\\\\tilde{r}_1}^2 -\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m_ea_0^2}\\\\nabla_{\\\\tilde{r}_2}^2+\\\\frac{e^2}{4\\\\pi \\\\epsilon_0 a_0}\\\\left(-\\\\frac{Z}{\\\\tilde{r}_1}-\\\\frac{Z}{\\\\tilde{r}_2}+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\tilde{r}_{12}}\\\\right)\\\\\\\\\\nH = -\\\\frac{e^4 m}{2(4\\\\pi\\\\epsilon_0)^2 \\\\hbar^2}\\\\nabla_{\\\\tilde{r}_1}^2 -\\\\frac{e^4 m}{2(4\\\\pi\\\\epsilon_0)^2 \\\\hbar^2}\\\\nabla_{\\\\tilde{r}_2}^2+\\\\frac{e^4 m}{(4\\\\pi \\\\epsilon_0)^2\\\\hbar^2}\\\\left(-\\\\frac{Z}{\\\\tilde{r}_1}-\\\\frac{Z}{\\\\tilde{r}_2}+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\tilde{r}_{12}}\\\\right)\\n$$\\n\\nAnd finally we can measure all energies in units of\\n$$E_0 = \\\\frac{e^4 m}{(4\\\\pi\\\\epsilon_0)^2\\\\hbar^2} = 1\\\\text{hartree} = 27.2\\\\text{eV}$$\\nSo the Hamiltonian reads in these natural units:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\tilde{H} = -\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\nabla_{\\\\tilde{r}_1}^2 -\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\nabla_{\\\\tilde{r}_2}^2+\\\\left(-\\\\frac{Z}{\\\\tilde{r}_1}-\\\\frac{Z}{\\\\tilde{r}_2}+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\tilde{r}_{12}}\\\\right)\\n$$\\n\\nAnother, more common, way of introducing this is to define:\\n\\n$$\\nm = \\\\hbar = e = 4\\\\pi \\\\epsilon_0 \\\\equiv 1\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\alpha = \\\\frac{e^2}{(4\\\\pi \\\\epsilon_0) \\\\hbar c}= \\\\frac{1}{137}\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\Rightarrow c = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\alpha}\\n$$\\n\\nWithin these units we have for the hydrogen atom:\\n$$E_n = \\\\frac{Z^2}{2}\\\\frac{1}{n^2}E_0$$\\n\\n**For the remainder of this lecture we will assume that we are working\\nin natural units and just omit the tildas.**\\n\\n## Electron-electron interaction\\n\\nNow we can decompose the Hamiltonian in the following fashion:\\n$$H = H_1 + H_2 + H_{12}$$ So without the coupling term between the\\nelectrons we would just have once again two hydrogen atoms. The whole\\ncrux is now that the term $H_{12}$ is actually coupling or\\n**entangling** the two electrons.\\n\\n## Symmetries\\n\\nThe **exchange** operator is defined as:\\n\\n$$\\nP_{12}\\\\psi(r_1,r_2) = \\\\psi(r_2, r_1)\\n$$\\n\\nWe directly see for the Hamiltonian of Helium in the reduced units that the exchange operator commutes with\\nthe Hamiltonian, $[H,P_{12}] = 0$. This implies directly that the parity\\nis a conserved quantity of the system and that we have a set of\\nEigenstates associated with the parity.\\n\\nWe can now apply the operator twice:\\n\\n$$\\nP_{12}^2\\\\psi(r_1,r_2) = \\\\lambda^2 \\\\psi(r_1, r_2) = \\\\psi(r_1, r_2)\\n$$\\n\\nSo we can see that there are two sets of eigenvalues with\\n$\\\\lambda = \\\\pm 1$.\\n\\n$$\\nP_{12}\\\\psi_\\\\pm = \\\\pm \\\\psi_\\\\pm\\n$$\\n\\nWe will call:\\n\\n- $\\\\psi_+$ are para-states\\n\\n- $\\\\psi_-$ are ortho-states\\n\\nThis symmetry is a really strong one and it was only recently that\\ndirect transitions between [ortho and para-states were observed](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/physrevlett.119.173401). Interestingly, we did not need to look into the spin\\nand the Pauli principle for this discussion at all. This will happen in\\nthe next step.\\n\\n## Spin and Pauli principle\\n\\nWe have seen that the Hamiltonian does not contain the spin degree of\\nfreedom. So we can decompose the total wave function as:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\overline{\\\\psi} = \\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{r}_1, \\\\mathbf{r}_2) \\\\cdot \\\\chi(1,2)\\n$$\\n\\n### Spin degree of freedom\\n\\nGiven that the electron is $s=\\\\frac{1}{2}$, we can decompose each\\nwavefunction as:\\n$$\\\\chi = \\\\alpha |\\\\uparrow\\\\rangle + \\\\beta |\\\\downarrow\\\\rangle$$ So if the\\ntwo spins were _not_ correlated, we could just write the spin\\nwavefunction as: $$\\\\chi(1,2) = \\\\chi_\\\\mathrm{1}\\\\cdot\\\\chi_\\\\mathrm{2}$$\\nHowever, the electron-electron interaction entangles the atoms. An\\nexample would be the singlet state:\\n$$\\\\chi(1,2) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}\\\\left(|\\\\uparrow \\\\downarrow\\\\rangle - |\\\\downarrow\\\\uparrow \\\\rangle\\\\right)$$\\n\\nTo construct the full wave function we need to take into account the\\n_Pauli_ principle, which telles us for Fermions that the _full_\\nwavefunction should anti-sysmmetrc under exchange of particles:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\overline{\\\\psi}(q_1, q_2, \\\\cdots, q_i,\\\\cdots,  q_j, \\\\cdots) =\\n-\\\\overline{\\\\psi}(q_1, q_2, \\\\cdots, q_j,\\\\cdots,  q_i, \\\\cdots)\\n$$\\n\\nThis tells us that each quantum state can be only occupied by a single\\nelectron at maximum.\\n\\nNow we can come back to the full wavefunction using the results of the\\nprevious section. We have:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\overline{\\\\psi}(1,2) = \\\\psi_{\\\\pm}(r_1,r_2)\\\\chi_\\\\mp(1,2)\\n$$\\n\\nwith\\n$P_{12}\\\\chi_\\\\pm = \\\\pm \\\\chi_\\\\pm$. Now can once again look for good\\nsolutions to this problem. It is basically the total spin\\n$\\\\mathbf{S} = \\\\mathbf{S}_1 + \\\\mathbf{S}_2$, or better $\\\\mathbf{S}^2$.\\nThis commutes with both the Hamiltonian and the parity operator, so it\\nis a conserved quantity. Sorting out the solutions we have\\n\\n$$\\n\\n\\\\chi*- = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}\\\\left(|\\\\uparrow\\\\downarrow\\\\rangle - |\\\\downarrow\\\\uparrow\\\\rangle\\\\right)\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\chi*{+,1} = |\\\\uparrow\\\\uparrow\\\\rangle \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\chi*{+,1} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}\\\\left(|\\\\uparrow\\\\downarrow\\\\rangle + |\\\\downarrow\\\\uparrow\\\\rangle\\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\chi*{+,-1} = |\\\\downarrow\\\\downarrow\\\\rangle \\\\\\\\\\n\\n\\n$$\\n\\nSo $\\\\chi_+$ is associated with spin 1 and $\\\\chi_-$ is\\nassociated with spin 0.\\n\\n[^1]: It's proper derivation is left to quantum field theory lectures\\n\\n[^2]: It should be as there is no external torque acting on the atom\\n\\n[^3]: see lecture 2 for a few words on the definition of such a set\\n\\n[^Bransden]: Brian Harold Bransden, Charles Jean Joachain.

For\\nthat we will expand our trial function $|\\\\psi\\\\rangle$ into the (unknown)\\neigenstates of $\\\\hat{H}$: $$|\\\\psi\\\\rangle = \\\\sum_n c_n |\\\\psi_n\\\\rangle$$\\nFor the energies this implies:\\n$$\\\\hat{H}|\\\\psi_n\\\\rangle = E_n|\\\\psi_n\\\\rangle$$ So we end up with:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\langle \\\\psi|H|\\\\psi\\\\rangle - E_0 = \\\\sum_n E_n c_n^*c_n - E_0 \\\\sum_n c_n^*c_n\\\\\\\\\\n= \\\\sum_n (E_n-E_0)|c_n|^2 \\\\geq 0\\n$$\\n\\nSo the variational principle always gives an upper bound\\non the ground state energy. The question is how good is this bound in\\neach individual case.\\n\\nTo apply the variational approach, we will introduce a variational\\nparameter. This parameter is typically guessed from physical intuition.\\nHere it will be the charge, which will be replaced by an _screened\\ncharge_ $Z_{eff}$.\\n\\nAs variational wavefunction, we will employ the groundstate of the\\nhydrogen atom, which reads:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\psi_{var}(r_1, r_2) = e^{-Z_{eff}(r_1+r_2)}\\n$$\\n\\nWe find then that the total energy is:\\n$$E_{var}^0 = Z_{eff}^2 -2ZZ_{eff}+\\\\frac{5}{8}Z_{eff}$$ It becomes\\nminimal at\\n\\n$$\\nZ_{eff} = Z- \\\\frac{5}{16}\\n$$\\n\\nSo at this stage, we might compare the different levels\\nof approximation to the experimental result:\\n\\n- The experimental observation is $E_{exp}^0=-2.90372$ hartree\\n\\n- The independent particle model predicts $E^0 = -4$ hartree.\\n\\n- First order pertubation theory predicts $E^0 = -2,709$ hartree.\\n\\n- The variational principle predicts $E^0 = -2.84$ hartree.\\n\\nThe best theories achieve an accuracy of $10^{-7}$, see [Hertel 2015,\\nChapter 7.2.5](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-54322-7_7).\\n\\n# Exchange Interaction\\n\\nUp to now we focused on the ground state properties of the $1^\\n1S$ state. In the next step we will try to understand the influence of\\nthe interaction term on the excited states (c.f. [Hertel 2015,\\nChapter 7](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-54322-7_7)). To attack this problem we will approach it pertubatively.\\n\\nWe saw that we could factorize the full wavefunction into external and\\ninternal degrees of freedom. Further, we have the singlet $\\\\chi_S$\\n(anti-symmetric) and triplet states $\\\\chi_T$ (symmetric) for the spin.\\nThis can now be combined too:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\overline{\\\\psi}_S(1,2) = \\\\psi_{+}(r_1, r_2)\\\\chi_S(1,2)\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\overline{\\\\psi}_T(1,2) = \\\\psi_{-}(r_1, r_2)\\\\chi_T(1,2)\\\\\\\\\\n$$\\n\\nIn a next step, we can construct $\\\\psi_{\\\\pm}$ from the eigenstates of\\nthe unperturbed Hamiltonian. We define the states\\n$\\\\left|q_1\\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\equiv \\\\left|n_1,l_1,m_1\\\\right\\\\rangle$\\nand\\n$\\\\left|q_2\\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\equiv \\\\left|n_2,l_2,m_2\\\\right\\\\rangle$.\\nThe properly symmetrized states are:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\left|\\\\psi_\\\\pm\\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}\\\\left( \\\\left|q_1\\\\right\\\\rangle_1 \\\\otimes \\\\left|q_2\\\\right\\\\rangle_2 \\\\pm \\\\left|q_2\\\\right\\\\rangle_1 \\\\otimes \\\\left|q_1\\\\right\\\\rangle_2 \\\\right)\\n$$\\n\\nNow we can perform an estimate of the energy shift on\\nthese states.\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\Delta E_{S,T} = \\\\left\\\\langle\\\\overline{\\\\psi_{S,T} }\\\\right|\\\\frac{1}{\\\\hat{r}_{12}} \\\\left|\\\\overline{\\\\psi_{S,T}}\\\\right\\\\rangle\\\\\\\\\\n= \\\\left\\\\langle\\\\psi_{+,- }\\\\right|\\\\frac{1}{\\\\hat{r}_{12}} \\\\left|\\\\psi_{+,- }\\\\right\\\\rangle\\n$$\\n\\nWe then get\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\Delta E_{S,T} = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left(\\\\left\\\\langle q_1 q_2 \\\\right| \\\\pm \\\\left\\\\langle q_2 q_1\\\\right|\\\\right) \\\\left| \\\\frac{1}{\\\\hat{r}_{12}} \\\\right| \\\\left( \\\\left|q_1 q_2\\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\pm \\\\left|q_2 q_1\\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\right)\\\\\\\\\\n= \\\\left\\\\langle q_1 q_2\\\\right| \\\\frac{1}{\\\\hat{r}_{12}}\\\\left|q_1 q_2\\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\pm \\\\left\\\\langle q_1 q_2\\\\right| \\\\frac{1}{\\\\hat{r}_{12}} \\\\left|q_2 q_1\\\\right\\\\rangle\\n$$\\n\\nSo we summarize:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\Delta E_S = J_{nl} + K_{nl}\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\Delta E_T = J_{nl} - K_{nl}\\n$$\\n\\nThe first term is called _direct_ (Coulomb) term and the second term is\\nknown as _exchange_ term.

This allows us to calculate\\nthe expectation value of the dipole operator through:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\langle \\\\vec{D}\\\\rangle = \\\\left\\\\langle\\\\psi\\\\right|\\\\vec{D}\\\\left|\\\\psi\\\\right\\\\rangle\\n$$\\n\\nAs already discussed in Lecture 6 we can then write it down as:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\langle \\\\vec{D}\\\\rangle = E_0 \\\\vec{\\\\alpha}\\n$$\\n\\nWe call $\\\\alpha$ the **polarizability**.

The linear relationship between polarization and electric field is\\n    only valid for weak electric fields. For stronger fields, higher\\n    order terms become important. They are the fundamental ingredient of\\n    non-linear optics. In general, we can write:\\n\\n$$\\n    P_i = \\\\epsilon_0 \\\\sum_{j}\\\\chi_{ij}^{1}E_j+\\\\epsilon_0 \\\\sum_{jk}\\\\chi_{ijk}^{2}E_jE_k + ...\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$$\\n\\n2.  Given that $\\\\chi$ and $\\\\alpha$ are proportional to\\n    $\\\\langle D \\\\rangle$, they can be complex. We will see that real and\\n    imaginary part have very different interpretations.\\n\\n## Propagation of light\\n\\nAt this stage we would like to understand the propagation of an electric\\nfield through such a polarized medium. The general Maxwell equation\\nactually reads:\\n\\n$$\\n\\n\\\\nabla^2 \\\\vec{E}-\\\\frac{1}{c^2}\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\vec{E}}{\\\\partial t^2}= \\\\frac{1}{\\\\epsilon_0 c^2}\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\vec{P}}{\\\\partial t^2}\\n$$\\n\\nThis equation can be massively simplified by only\\nlooking at a slowly-evolving envelope $\\\\mathcal{E}(r,t)$ and\\n$\\\\mathcal{P}(r,t)$, which are defined through:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\vec{E} = \\\\mathcal{E} e^{ikz-i \\\\omega_L t}\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\vec{P} = \\\\mathcal{P} e^{ikz-i \\\\omega_L t}\\\\\\\\\\n$$\\n\\nAs shown in more detail in [Chapter 4 of Lukin](http://lukin.physics.harvard.edu/wp-uploads/Papers/285b_notes_2005-1.Lily.pdf), the Maxwell equation reduces then to:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial z}\\\\mathcal{E}+\\\\frac{1}{c}\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t}\\\\mathcal{E} = \\\\frac{ik}{2\\\\epsilon_0}\\\\mathcal{P}\\n$$\\n\\nThis equation becomes especially transparent, if we investigate it for\\nvery long times, such that we can perform a Fourier transformation and\\nobtain:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial z}\\\\mathcal{E}= i\\\\frac{\\\\omega}{c}\\\\mathcal{E} +\\\\frac{ik}{2\\\\epsilon_0}\\\\mathcal{P}\\n$$\\n\\nFinally, we can use the definition of the susceptibility to write:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial z}\\\\mathcal{E}= i\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\omega}{c} +\\\\frac{k}{2} \\\\chi(\\\\omega)\\\\right) \\\\mathcal{E}\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\mathcal{E}(\\\\omega, z) =E_0 e^{i\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\omega}{c} +\\\\frac{k}{2}\\\\chi(\\\\omega)\\\\right)z}\\n$$\\n\\n### Absorption and refraction\\n\\nThe meaning of the susceptibility becomes especially clear for a\\ncontinuous wave, where $\\\\omega\\\\rightarrow 0$ and we obtain:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\mathcal{E}(\\\\omega\\\\rightarrow 0, z) =E_0 e^{i\\\\frac{k\\\\chi(0)}{2} z}\\n$$\\n\\nWe can then see that:\\n\\n- The imaginary part of the susceptibility leads to absorption on a\\n  scale $l^{-1} = \\\\frac{k}{2}\\\\text{Im}(\\\\chi(0))$\\n\\n- The real part describes a phase shift. The evolution of the electric\\n  field can be seen as propagating with a wavevector\\n  $k \\\\rightarrow k +\\\\frac{k}{2}\\\\text{Re}(\\\\chi(0))$, so the dielectric\\n  medium has a refractive index $n = 1 + \\\\frac{\\\\text{Re}(\\\\chi(0))}{2}$\\n\\n### Dispersion\\n\\nIf the electric field has a certain frequency distribution, we might\\nhave to perform the proper integral to obtain the time evolution, i.e.:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\mathcal{E}(t, z) =\\\\int d\\\\omega e^{-i\\\\omega t}\\\\mathcal{E}(\\\\omega,0) e^{i\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\omega}{c} +\\\\frac{k}{2}\\\\chi(\\\\omega)\\\\right)z}\\n$$\\n\\nTo solve the problem we can develop the susceptibility:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\chi(\\\\omega) = \\\\chi(0)+\\\\frac{d\\\\chi}{d\\\\omega}\\\\omega\\n$$\\n\\nAnd we obtain:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\mathcal{E}(t, z) =e^{izk\\\\chi(0)/2}\\n\\\\mathcal{E}(t-z/v_g, 0)\\\\\\\\\\nv_g = \\\\frac{c}{1+\\\\frac{\\\\omega_L}{2}\\\\frac{d\\\\chi}{d\\\\omega}}\\n$$\\n\\nSo the group velocity is controlled by the derivative of the\\nsusceptibility !\\n\\n## Two level system\\n\\nAfter this rather general discussion, we will now employ it to\\nunderstand the action of two-level systems on the travelling beam. So we\\nwill now focus on the influence of the atoms on the field in comparision\\nwith the previous discussions. Further, we will have to take into\\naccount the finite lifetime of the excited states in a phenomenological\\nmanner. For a two level system with excited state\\n$\\\\left|e\\\\right\\\\rangle$ and groundstate\\n$\\\\left|g\\\\right\\\\rangle$, we can directly write down the\\nwavefunction as:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\left|\\\\psi\\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\gamma_g\\\\left|g\\\\right\\\\rangle+ \\\\gamma_e\\\\left|e\\\\right\\\\rangle\\n$$\\n\\nIn this basis, the dipole element reads:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\langle D\\\\rangle = \\\\left\\\\langle e\\\\right|D\\\\left|g\\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\gamma_e^*\\\\gamma_g\\\\\\\\\\n= d \\\\sigma_{eg}\\n$$\\n\\nIn the second line we introduced the notations:\\n\\n- $d = \\\\left\\\\langle e\\\\right|D\\\\left|g\\\\right\\\\rangle$\\n\\n- The product $\\\\gamma_e^*\\\\gamma_g$ can identified with the\\n  off-diagonal component of the density operator\\n  $\\\\sigma=\\\\left|\\\\psi\\\\right\\\\rangle\\\\left\\\\langle\\\\psi\\\\right|$.\\n  We will often call it **coherence**.\\n\\nThe Hamiltonian of this model reads then in the rotating\\nwave-approximation:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\hat{H} = 0\\\\left|g\\\\right\\\\rangle\\\\left\\\\langle g\\\\right|+\\\\hbar\\\\delta \\\\left|e\\\\right\\\\rangle\\\\left\\\\langle e\\\\right| + \\\\hbar\\\\Omega\\\\left[\\\\left|e\\\\right\\\\rangle\\\\left\\\\langle g\\\\right|+\\\\left|g\\\\right\\\\rangle\\\\left\\\\langle e\\\\right|\\\\right]\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\Omega = d E/\\\\hbar\\n$$\\n\\nThis is exactly the model that we discussed in the\\nlectures 3 and 4 [@Jendrzejewskib; @Jendrzejewskia]. We then found that\\nthe time evolution might be described via:\\n\\n$$\\ni\\\\dot{\\\\gamma}_g(t) = \\\\Omega \\\\gamma_e\\\\\\\\\\ni\\\\dot{\\\\gamma}_e(t) = \\\\delta \\\\gamma_e +\\\\Omega \\\\gamma_g\\\\\\\\\\n$$\\n\\nWe can combine them to the components of the density\\noperator, which then read:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\sigma_{ij} = c_{i}^*c_j\\n$$\\n\\nFrom these coefficients, we can now obtain the evolution\\nof the populations:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\dot{N}_g = \\\\dot{\\\\sigma}_{gg} = \\\\dot{\\\\gamma}_{g}^*\\\\gamma_g+ \\\\gamma_{g}^*\\\\dot{\\\\gamma}_g\\\\\\\\\\n= i\\\\Omega(\\\\sigma_{eg}-\\\\sigma_{ge})\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\dot{N}_e = -\\\\dot{N}_g\\n$$\\n\\nSo the total number of atoms stays automatically\\nconserved. As for the coherences we obtain:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\dot{\\\\sigma}_{eg} = \\\\dot{\\\\gamma}_{e}^*\\\\gamma_g+ \\\\gamma_{e}^*\\\\dot{\\\\gamma}_g\\\\\\\\\\n= i\\\\delta \\\\sigma_{eg}+i (N_g-N_e)\\\\Omega\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\dot{\\\\sigma}_{ge}= -i\\\\delta \\\\sigma_{ge}-i (N_g-N_e)\\\\Omega\\n$$\\n\\nThis density operator approach allows us to introduce spontaneous decay\\nin a very straight-forward fashion:\\n\\n- The time evolution of the excited state gets an additional term\\n  $-\\\\Gamma N_e$.\\n\\n- Atoms coming from the excited state relax to the ground state, so we\\n  add a term $\\\\Gamma N_e$.\\n\\n- The coherence decays also through a term $-\\\\Gamma_2 \\\\sigma_{ge}$. We\\n  will use here for simplicity the limit of $\\\\Gamma_2 = \\\\Gamma/2$\\n\\nSo the full equations read now:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\dot{N}_g = i\\\\Omega(\\\\sigma_{eg}-\\\\sigma_{ge})+\\\\Gamma N_e\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\dot{\\\\sigma}_{ge}= -i\\\\delta \\\\sigma_{ge}-i (N_g-N_e)\\\\Omega-\\\\Gamma_2\\\\sigma_{ge}\\n$$\\n\\nAt this stage we can find the steady-state solutions by setting\\n$\\\\dot{N}_g = \\\\dot{\\\\sigma}_{ge} = 0$. This leads too:\\n\\n$$\\n\\nN_e = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\frac{\\\\Omega^2 \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma_2}{\\\\Gamma}}{(\\\\omega_0-\\\\omega_L)^2+\\\\Gamma_2^2+\\\\Omega^2\\\\frac{\\\\Gamma_2}{\\\\Gamma}}\\n$$\\n\\n$$\\n\\n\\\\sigma_{ge} = i\\\\frac{\\\\Omega}{2}\\\\frac{\\\\Gamma_2-i(\\\\omega_L-\\\\omega_0)}{\\\\Gamma_2^2+(\\\\omega_0-\\\\omega_L)^2+\\\\Omega^2\\\\Gamma_2/\\\\Gamma}\\n$$\\n\\nIn the next lecture we will employ those results to\\nstudy the laser.","order":10},{"title":"Lecture 11 - Laser fundamentals","content":"\\nWe will study some basic properties of the laser.\\n\\nIn the last lecture we studied the interaction of atoms\\nand light.

We\\ncan describe losses by the aborption rate $A$. The transmission of the\\nsemi-transparent mirror is quantified by the transmission coefficient\\n$T$. Putting it all together, the intensity just before reentering the\\nmedium reads then $G^{(0)}I_A(1-T)(1-A)$. Amplification will happen if\\nthis intensity is higher than the initial one:\\n\\n$$\\nG^{(0)}>\\\\frac{1}{(1-T)(1-A)}\\n$$\\n\\nWe will see that such a configuration is not trivial at all on the\\ntwo-level system. Then we will discuss the appropiate configuration for\\nlasing and a few properties of the laser.\\n\\n## The two level system\\n\\nIn the last lecture, we saw that the two-level system might be described\\nby the following rate equations:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\dot{N}_g = i\\\\Omega(\\\\sigma_{eg}-\\\\sigma_{ge})+\\\\Gamma N_e\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\dot{\\\\sigma}_{ge}= -i\\\\delta \\\\sigma_{ge}-i (N_g-N_e)\\\\Omega-\\\\frac{\\\\Gamma}{2}\\\\sigma_{ge}\\n$$\\n\\nThe definitions were:\\n\\n- $\\\\Omega$ is the strength of the Rabi coupling.\\n\\n- $\\\\delta$ the detuning.\\n\\n- $\\\\Gamma$ is the lifetime of the excited state.\\n\\n- $N_g$ the groundstate population.\\n\\n- And $\\\\sigma_{g,e}$ is the coherence\\n  $\\\\sigma_{g,e} = \\\\gamma_g^* \\\\gamma_e$.\\n\\n- $\\\\Gamma_2$ is the lifetime of the coherence. For the moment we will\\n  work in the limit $\\\\Gamma_2 = \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma}{2}$. Let we will relax\\n  this point a bit.\\n\\nAt this stage we can find the steady-state solutions by setting\\n$\\\\dot{N}_g = \\\\dot{\\\\sigma}_{ge} = 0$. This leads too:\\n\\n$$\\n\\nN_e = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\frac{\\\\Omega^2}{2\\\\delta^2+\\\\Gamma^2/2+\\\\Omega^2}\\n$$\\n\\n$$\\n\\n\\\\sigma_{ge} = i\\\\frac{\\\\Omega}{2}\\\\frac{\\\\Gamma-i2\\\\delta}{2\\\\delta^2+\\\\Gamma^2/2+\\\\Omega^2}\\n$$\\n\\nWe will now discuss these results in the two important regimes of very\\nweak and very strong coupling. The first one is important for probe\\nexperiments, while the second one is typically the one, where we would\\nlike to operate a laser.\\n\\n### Linear response\\n\\nFor very small coupling strength we can neglect the $\\\\Omega$ dependence\\nin the coherence and we obtain:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\sigma_{ge} = \\\\frac{\\\\Omega}{2}\\\\frac{\\\\delta+i\\\\Gamma/2}{\\\\Gamma^2/4+\\\\delta^2}\\n$$\\n\\nWe can now plug this into the dipole element [^1]:\\n\\n$$\\nD = d \\\\sigma_{eg}\\\\\\\\\\nD = \\\\frac{d^2}{2}\\\\frac{\\\\delta-i\\\\Gamma/2}{\\\\Gamma^2/4+\\\\delta^2}E\\n$$\\n\\nIn the second line, we used the relationship\\n$\\\\Omega = dE$ from lecture 4 [@Jendrzejewskia]. We can then directly\\nread of the polarizability and hence the susceptibility, which was\\ndefined through $D = \\\\alpha E$:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\alpha =\\\\frac{d^2}{2}\\\\frac{\\\\delta-i\\\\Gamma/2}{\\\\Gamma^2/4+\\\\delta^2}\\n$$\\n\\nOn resonance $\\\\delta=0$ we have:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\alpha(0) =-i\\\\frac{d^2}{\\\\Gamma}\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\chi(0) = -i\\\\frac{n}{\\\\epsilon_0}\\\\frac{d^2}{\\\\Gamma}\\n$$\\n\\nWe obtain now rather directly that:\\n\\n- Absorption is maximal on resonance.\\n\\n- There is no dephasing on resonance.\\n\\n- For large detunings the absorption can be increasingly neglected and\\n  the media becomes refractive as it only keeps an optical index.\\n\\nWe can then also look for maximum dephasing and find the it happens\\nclose to the resonance. A summary can be found in Fig.\\n[2](#fig-susc).\\n\\n<figure id=\\"fig-susc\\">\\n<img src=\\"./lecture11_pic2.png\\" width=\\"70%\\" />\\n<figcaption>Susceptibility of the two level system. Figure taken from <a href=\\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/introduction-to-quantum-optics/F45DCE785DC8226D4156EC15CAD5FA9A\\">Grynberg</a>.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n### Saturation\\n\\nThe population and coherence in the two-level system will saturate as a\\nsubstantial amount of atoms is excited. To simplify the discussion let\\nus rewrite the eq. the populations and coherence of the two-level system on resonance:\\n\\n$$\\nN_e = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\frac{\\\\Omega^2}{\\\\Gamma^2/2+\\\\Omega^2}\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\sigma_{ge} = i\\\\frac{\\\\Omega}{2}\\\\frac{\\\\Gamma}{\\\\Gamma^2/2+\\\\Omega^2}\\n$$\\n\\nWe can see that the excited fraction is limited to $1/2$\\nof the atoms. So at some point the system cannot react anymore to the\\nadditional coupling strength. This is also the reason for the decay of\\nthe coherence at very large $\\\\Omega$, which is basically telling us that\\nthe medium becomes transparent. This kind of observations motivates for\\npractical purposes to introduce the saturation intensity\\n$I_{sat} \\\\propto \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma^2}{2}$, which allows us to rewrite the\\nprevious to equations as:\\n\\n$$\\nN_e = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\frac{I/I_{sat}}{1+I/I_{sat}}\\n$$\\n\\nFinally, this kind of expressions allows us also nicely to see the\\ndirect connection between the dipole element and the number of excited\\natoms:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\sigma_{ge} = i\\\\frac{N_e}{\\\\Omega}\\n$$\\n\\nSo we never obtain a situation, where the two-level\\nsystem amplifies light. Let us look into this situation once again from\\na technical point of view to see if we can obtain situations of\\namplificiation.\\n\\n## Rate equations\\n\\nTo understand laser it is best to formulate the interaction of atoms and\\nlight in terms of rate equations for the populations, assuming that the\\ncoherences follow adiabatically. While strict derivations can become\\nvery tedious, they can be written down in a phenomenological way rather\\neasily. So we will convince us here in some limiting cases of the\\nusefulness.\\n\\nWe now would like to use the previous discussions to set up the\\nnecessary formalism for laser amplification, which is based on the idea\\nof rate equations. While these equations are of phenomenological nature,\\nwe can convince ourselves of their soundness in a first step.\\n\\n### The two-level system\\n\\nIn the last lecture we saw that we can write down the following Bloch\\nequations for the two-level system on resonance:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\dot{N}_g = -i\\\\Omega(\\\\sigma_{eg}-\\\\sigma_{ge})+\\\\Gamma N_e\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\dot{\\\\sigma}_{ge}= i (N_g-N_e)\\\\Omega-\\\\Gamma_2\\\\sigma_{ge}\\n$$\\n\\nIn a substantial amount of situations the coherences\\nreach the steady state much faster than the population. This can be due\\nto technical noise, collisions or other effects. In this case we can\\nassume $\\\\dot{\\\\sigma}_{ge}=0$ and the solve for the populations:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\sigma_{ge}= i \\\\frac{\\\\Omega}{\\\\Gamma_2} (N_g-N_e)\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\sigma_{eg}-\\\\sigma_{ge} = -2i \\\\frac{\\\\Omega}{\\\\Gamma_2} (N_g-N_e)\\n$$\\n\\nWe can see in this limit that the inversion of the sign\\nof the dipole element would come with $N_g < N_e$ **in the\\nsteady-state**. We saw previously that we cannot achieve this limit in\\nthe two-level system.\\n\\nHaving eliminated adiabatically the coherences, we end up with the\\nfollowing time evolution of the population:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\dot{N}_g = 2\\\\frac{\\\\Omega^2}{\\\\Gamma_2}(N_e-N_g)+\\\\Gamma N_e\\\\\\\\\\n$$\\n\\nWe can now identify the three terms as:\\n\\n- Stimulated emission.\\n\\n- Stimulated absorption.\\n\\n- Spontaneous emission.\\n\\nWe will then focus on the rate equation for the populations and attempt\\nto find situations, where $N_g < N_e$.\\n\\n### Optional: Rate equations for light\\n\\nTo see, when light amplification will happen, we now need to connect the\\nrate equations to evolution of light within the medium. One heuristic\\napproach is guided by the Beer-Lambert law (Ch. 4.2.3 of [Hertel 2015](https://doi.org/10.1007%2F978-3-642-54322-7)\\n).\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{dI}{dz}=- N_g\\\\sigma I\\n$$\\n\\nWe would like to translate this now more precisely into\\na change of photon numbers through the relation:\\n\\n$$\\nI = c \\\\hbar\\\\omega N_{ph}\\n$$\\n\\nThis allows us to rewrite for a propagation wave with\\n$z = ct$:\\n\\n$$\\n- \\\\frac{N_g\\\\sigma I}{\\\\hbar \\\\omega} = \\\\frac{d}{dt}N_{ph} = \\\\frac{dN_g}{dt} = -\\\\frac{dN_e}{dt}\\n$$\\n\\nThis allows us to define an absorption rate:\\n\\n$$\\nR_{ab} =  \\\\frac{\\\\sigma I}{\\\\hbar \\\\omega}\\\\\\\\\\n= \\\\frac{1}{N_g}\\\\frac{dN_g}{dt}\\n$$\\n\\nThis process is just the description of **stimulated\\nabsorption**. Nothing was special about the discussion of the absorption\\nand we can actually also have exactly the inverse situation, where we\\nassume that all the atoms start out in the excited state and then lead\\nto an increased intensity:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{dI}{dz}= N_e\\\\sigma I\\n$$\\n\\nBoth processes are now computing and we obtain in\\ngeneral:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{dI}{dz}= (N_e-N_g)\\\\sigma I\\n$$\\n\\nSo if we have most atoms in the excited state and neglect the atoms in\\nthe ground state we can actually have light amplification. This is idea\\nis underlying the laser. However, we have already seen for the two-level\\nsystem that this situation is not easily achieved and we will now\\ndiscuss it a bit further.\\n\\n## Lasing condition in a four-level system\\n\\nTo obtain in the medium, it is necessary to have an excited state\\npopulation which is higher than the population of the ground state. This\\nis not possible in the two-level system and in practice realized mostly\\nin four-level systems.\\n\\n<figure id=\\"fig-4level\\">\\n<img src=\\"./lecture11_pic3.png\\" width=\\"70%\\" />\\n<figcaption>The 4 level system.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\nThe idea of such a system is the following:\\n\\n- A strong pumping beam excites atoms into the state $e$.\\n\\n- From $e$ they decay rapidely into the state b. This is the upper\\n  state for the lasing transition $b\\\\rightarrow a$.\\n\\n- We obtain lasing on the transition $b\\\\rightarrow a$, which has a\\n  decay rate of $\\\\tau_B$\\n\\n- The lower state $a$ is easily depopulated through the fast\\n  relaxation $a\\\\rightarrow g$.\\n\\nWe can now write down the rate equations for a weak laser, such that we\\ncan only keep terms in first order:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\dot{N}_e = w(N_g-N_e)-N_e/\\\\tau_e\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\dot{N}_b = \\\\frac{N_e}{\\\\tau_e}-N_b/\\\\tau_b\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\dot{N}_a = \\\\frac{N_b}{\\\\tau_b}-N_a/\\\\tau_a\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\dot{N}_g = \\\\frac{N_a}{\\\\tau_a}-w(N_g-N_e)\\n$$\\n\\nWe can now find steady state solutions assuming that\\n$\\\\tau_e, \\\\tau_a \\\\ll \\\\tau_b$. Further we assume that the pumping to $e$\\nis not too strong, i.e. $w \\\\tau_e\\\\ll1$. We then obtain:\\n\\n$$\\nN_e \\\\simeq w\\\\tau_e N_g\\\\\\\\\\nN_b \\\\simeq w\\\\tau_b N_g\\\\\\\\\\nN_a \\\\simeq w\\\\tau_a N_g\\n$$\\n\\nWe then obtain the state populations:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{N_b-N_a}{N_g + N_e + N_a + N_b}\\\\simeq \\\\frac{w\\\\tau_b}{1+w\\\\tau_b}\\n$$\\n\\nLasing is then obtained above the pumping threshold at which the gain\\novercomes the losses.\\n\\n## Steady-state operation of the laser\\n\\nAssuming that the lasing condition is fullfilled, we can now investigate\\nits steady-state behavior. Quite importantly, we have to have an\\nelectric field, which remains exactly constant after each round\\ntrip.This implies to conditions:\\n\\n- The gain has to cancel the losses:\\n\\n$$\\n    G = \\\\frac{1}{(1-T)(1-A)}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$$\\n\\n- The phase after the round trip has to be a multiple of $2\\\\pi$\\n\\nFor a cavity of length $L$, the wavelength $\\\\lambda_p$ has to be an\\ninteger fraction:\\n\\n$$\\nL_{cav} = p\\\\lambda_p\\\\text{ with }p \\\\in  \\\\mathbb{N}\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\omega_p/2\\\\pi =p \\\\frac{c}{L}\\n$$\\n\\nSo the lasing will not happen at one single frequency,\\nbut actually for any wavelength fulfilling this condition. The laser has\\nmultiple **longitudinal modes**. Some tricks allow to suppress this\\nmulti-mode behavior, such that we obtain a very pure light source.\\n\\n<figure id=\\"fig-freq-laser\\">\\n<img src=\\"./lecture11_pic4.png\\" width=\\"70%\\" />\\n<figcaption>Frequency distribution of the steady-state laser.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n## Mode-locked operation\\n\\nWe have seen in the last section that a laser might act in the multimode\\nregime. So let us write down for simplicity the total field, where we\\nassume that the relative phase between modes in uncorrelated and that\\nthe amplitude is the same for all of them. We then have:\\n\\n$$\\nE(t) = \\\\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}E_0 \\\\cos(\\\\omega_k t +\\\\phi_k)\\n$$\\n\\nThe frequency of each mode:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\omega_k = \\\\omega_0 + k \\\\Delta\\\\text{ with }\\\\Delta/2\\\\pi = \\\\frac{c}{L_{cav}}\\n$$\\n\\nSumming the electric fields leads to an intensity:\\n\\n$$\\nI(t)= \\\\frac{NE_0^2}{2}+E_0^2\\\\sum_{j_k}\\\\cos\\\\left[(\\\\omega_j-\\\\omega_k)t+\\\\phi_j-\\\\phi_k\\\\right]\\n$$\\n\\nFor uncorrelated fields this intensity is on average\\n$\\\\overline{I} = \\\\frac{NE_0^2}{2}$ with temporal fluctuations in the\\norder of the amplitude itself [^2] For correlated fields the equations\\nsimplify a lot and we obtain:\\n\\n$$\\nI = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left|\\\\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}E_0e^{-i\\\\omega_k t}\\\\right|^2\\\\\\\\\\n = \\\\frac{E_0^2}{2}\\\\left|\\\\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}e^{i k\\\\Delta  t}\\\\right|^2\\\\\\\\\\n = \\\\frac{E_0^2}{2}\\\\left|\\\\frac{\\\\sin(\\\\frac{N\\\\Delta t}{2})}{\\\\sin(\\\\frac{\\\\Delta t}{2})}\\\\right|^2\\n$$\\n\\nThe maximum intensity in this coherent sum is now\\n\\n$$\\nI_{max} = N\\\\overline{I}\\n$$\\n\\nWe can then reach petawatt (!!) peak powers.\\n\\nIn the next lecture, we will study how the laser is actually used for the study of entanglement\\n\\n[^1]:\\n    The sign change appears as we are now working with $\\\\sigma_{eg}$\\n    instead of $\\\\sigma_{ge}$\\n\\n[^2]: We obtain actually a speckle pattern in time here.","order":11},{"title":"Lecture 12- Entanglement","content":"\\nWe will discuss the creation of entangled photons and how they can be\\nused for the test of Bell's inequalities.\\n\\nWe have previously discussed how complicated gain media allow for the\\namplification light.

Two polarizers can be used to probe the\\npolarization of the photons.\\n\\n## Three-wave mixing\\n\\nThe crystal in the medium is a non-linear crystal, which means that we\\ncan write the polarization is not just linear, but higher order terms\\nwill play a role. We will consider for starters that there are actually\\ntwo pump waves in the same direction, which allows us to write:\\n\\n$$\\nP_{NL}(z) = 2\\\\epsilon_0 \\\\chi^{(2)}\\\\mathcal{E}_1(z)\\\\mathcal{E}_2(z)e^{i(k_1+k_2)z}\\n$$\\n\\nThis non-linear polarizability leads to the following\\nequations of motion [@grynberg]:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{d\\\\mathcal{E}_3}{dz}e^{ik_3 z} = \\\\frac{i\\\\omega_3}{2\\\\epsilon_0n_3c}P_{NL}(z) \\\\\\\\\\n \\\\frac{d\\\\mathcal{E}_3}{dz}= \\\\frac{i\\\\omega_3}{n_3c}\\\\chi^{(2)}\\\\mathcal{E}_1(z)\\\\mathcal{E}_2(z)e^{i(k_1+k_2-k_3)z} \\\\\\\\,\\n$$\\n\\nwhere $\\\\omega_3 = \\\\omega_1 + \\\\omega_2$. We can now\\nadditionally assume that:\\n\\n- The effect of the medium does not change the strong pump to much.\\n\\n- The amplified field is zero initially.\\n\\n- The oscillating phase factor $(k_1+k_2-k_3)z$ can be ignored, i.e.\\n  where we have:\\n\\n$$\\n    \\\\vec{k}_3 = \\\\vec{k}_1 + \\\\vec{k}_2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$$\\n\\nWe can then simplify to:\\n\\n$$\\n \\\\frac{d\\\\mathcal{E}_3}{dz}=\\\\frac{i\\\\omega_3 \\\\chi^{(2)}}{n_3c}\\\\mathcal{E}_1\\\\mathcal{E}_2\\n$$\\n\\nSo the amplitude of the mixed field increases in a\\nlinear fashion in the non-linear medium. However, the typical amplitude\\nfor production is below 1% for commonly used crystals.\\n\\n# Polarization entangled photons\\n\\nWe will try to observe correlations between the photons. Two optical\\nfibers are collecting the pairs of photons and transmit them to the\\nsingle photon detectors. Finite collection and detection efficiency\\ncauses only one of the two photons to be detected in most cases.\\nTherefore, a coincidence circuit registers events in which two photons\\narrive within 30 ns. As the rate of detected individual photons is about\\n50 kHz, we assume that photons arriving during such a small time window\\nwere created in the same event.\\n\\n## Polarization analysis\\n\\nTo study the quantum nature of the correlations, we will employ\\npolarizers and later dive into Bell's inequalities as well as\\nentanglement in general. The interested reader will have a great time\\nreading through the complement 5.C of [Grynberg](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/introduction-to-quantum-optics/F45DCE785DC8226D4156EC15CAD5FA9A).\\n\\nThe first emitted photon is analyzed by a rotatable polarizers\\n$\\\\hat{A}(\\\\theta)$, which has two detection paths $\\\\pm1$. The other\\npolarizer will be called $\\\\hat{B}(\\\\theta)$ the only difference is that\\nhe only acts on photon 2. Basically, we are following the _Alice_ and\\n_Bob_ notation here.\\n\\nWe can express it then in our basis states of vertical polarization\\n$\\\\left|V\\\\right\\\\rangle$ and horizontal polarization\\n$\\\\left|H\\\\right\\\\rangle$. The polarizer aligned with $H$ has\\neigenvalues:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\hat{A} \\\\left|H\\\\right\\\\rangle= +\\\\left|H\\\\right\\\\rangle\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\hat{A} \\\\left|V\\\\right\\\\rangle= -\\\\left|V\\\\right\\\\rangle\\n$$\\n\\nTo analyse the polarization of each photon in detail we can also rotate\\nthe polarizer by an angle of $\\\\theta$. In this case the transmitted\\neigenstates are:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\left|\\\\theta\\\\right\\\\rangle_{+} = \\\\cos(\\\\theta)\\\\left|H\\\\right\\\\rangle +\\\\sin(\\\\theta)\\\\left|V\\\\right\\\\rangle\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\left|\\\\theta\\\\right\\\\rangle_{-} = -\\\\sin(\\\\theta)\\\\left|H\\\\right\\\\rangle +\\\\cos(\\\\theta)\\\\left|V\\\\right\\\\rangle\\n$$\\n\\nTaking as input states\\n$\\\\left|H\\\\right\\\\rangle$, we simply find Malus law:\\n\\n$$\\nP_+(\\\\theta) = \\\\cos(\\\\theta)^2\\\\\\\\\\nP_-(\\\\theta) = \\\\sin(\\\\theta)^2\\\\\\\\\\n$$\\n\\nIn the rotated basis we can express the polarization\\noperator as:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\hat{A}(\\\\theta) = \\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{cc}\\n\\\\cos(2\\\\theta)& \\\\sin(2\\\\theta)\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\sin(2\\\\theta)& -\\\\cos(2\\\\theta)\\n\\\\end{array}\\\\right)\\n$$\\n\\nWe can now employ the two polarizers to investigate the\\ntwo emitted photons as shown in Fig. [2](#fig-polar-anal).\\n\\n<figure id=\\"fig-polar-anal\\">\\n<img src=\\"./lecture12_pic2.png\\" width=\\"90%\\" />\\n<figcaption>Polarization analysis of correlated photons</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\nThe possible outcome of our experiments are the four states\\n$\\\\{HH, HV, VH, VV\\\\}$ and hence we could decompose our full wavefunction\\nas:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\left|\\\\psi\\\\right\\\\rangle = c_0 \\\\left|HH\\\\right\\\\rangle+ c_1 \\\\left|HV\\\\right\\\\rangle + c_2 \\\\left|VH\\\\right\\\\rangle + c_3\\\\left|VV\\\\right\\\\rangle\\n$$\\n\\nUsing the two polarizers we can now start to investigate\\nthe prefactors of the full wavefunction. Let us first look into the\\nresults of a polarizer that is not rotated. We find:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\left\\\\langle\\\\psi\\\\right|\\\\hat{A}\\\\left|\\\\psi\\\\right\\\\rangle=|c_0|^2 + |c_1|^2 - |c_2|^2-|c_3|^2\\n$$\\n\\nFor Bobs polarizer in the same position we would find:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\left\\\\langle\\\\psi\\\\right|\\\\hat{B}\\\\left|\\\\psi\\\\right\\\\rangle=|c_0|^2+ |c_2|^2 - |c_1|^2 -|c_3|^2\\n$$\\n\\n## An equivalent 2 qubit circuit\\n\\nThe optics setup handles two independent photons, with two outcomes\\neach. So we can also see the presented setup as a two qubit system. A\\ncircuit diagram would mostly look the following way.\\n\\n<figure id=\\"fig-two-qubit\\">\\n<img src=\\"./lecture12_pic3.png\\" width=\\"90%\\" />\\n<figcaption>Realizing the two-photon experiment within a quantum circuit. What are\\nthe correlations the two photons have ?</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\nThe two photons originate from an unknown source, which is here modelled\\nby photons propagating through some unitary matrix $\\\\hat{U}$. The\\nmeasurement is performed in the last step, projecting the qubit on its\\nup or down state. The rotation around the x axis $\\\\hat{R}_x$ transforms\\na qubit state into a superposition. In strong analogy to the\\npolarization\\n\\n## A naive guess\\n\\nWe know that we have two photons in the system. Both can have some\\npolarization and clearly they are propagation in different directions.\\nSo it does not seems to much of a stretch to guess that the total\\nwavefunction is the product of two superposition states:\\n\\n$$\\n\\n\\\\left|\\\\psi\\\\right\\\\rangle_{p} = (c_{H,1}\\\\left|H\\\\right\\\\rangle +c_{V,1} \\\\left|V\\\\right\\\\rangle)\\\\otimes(c_{H,2}\\\\left|H\\\\right\\\\rangle+c_{V,2}\\\\left|V\\\\right\\\\rangle) \\\\\\\\\\n= (c_{H,1}c_{H,2}\\\\left|HH\\\\right\\\\rangle + c_{V,1}c_{V,2}\\\\left|VV\\\\right\\\\rangle + c_{V,1}c_{H,2}\\\\left|VH\\\\right\\\\rangle + c_{H,1}c_{V,2}\\\\left|HV\\\\right\\\\rangle)\\n$$\\n\\n## The experimental observation of entanglement\\n\\n- We find a lot of counts if both polarizers are set vertical or\\n  horizontal. So the state has a $VV$ and a $HH$ component, which\\n  tells us that $c_0$ and $c_{3}$ are non-zero. The equal rate of\\n  measuring further tells us that they are roughly similiar in\\n  amplitude, so we can write for simplicity $|c_0| = |c_3|$\\n\\n- We find zero correlation if the polarizers are opposite. So the\\n  mixed terms are zero $c_1 = c_2 = 0$\\n\\nIn summary we can expect the Bell state can to be written as:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\left|\\\\psi_B\\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\frac{\\\\left|HH\\\\right\\\\rangle +\\\\left|VV\\\\right\\\\rangle}{\\\\sqrt{2}}\\n$$\\n\\nThis is quite clearly incompatible with our naive guess, which means that we have an entangled state.\\n\\n# Optional: Quantifying entanglement\\n\\nWe will study the properties of the entangled states later in more\\ndetail. However, we will take a short moment to cite two ways of\\nquanitfying the entanglement through the density operator:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\hat{\\\\rho} = \\\\sum_i \\\\eta_i \\\\left|i\\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\left\\\\langle i\\\\right|\\n$$\\n\\nThe reduced density operator, which shows mixed states if there is\\nentanglement:\\n\\n$$\\n    \\\\hat{\\\\rho}_1 = \\\\mathrm{tr}_{2}(\\\\hat{\\\\rho})\\n$$\\n\\nIn this case, $\\\\hat{\\\\rho}$ is the density operator\\nof a pure state and $\\\\textrm{tr}_2$ is the trace over the Hilbert\\nspace of particle 2.\\n\\nThe von Neumann entropy, which measures the remaining uncertainty\\nwithin a quantum state:\\n\\n$$\\n    S=-\\\\mathrm{tr}(\\\\hat{\\\\rho}\\\\ln\\\\hat{\\\\rho})\\\\\\\\\\n     = - \\\\sum_i \\\\eta_i \\\\ln \\\\eta_i = \\\\sum_i \\\\eta_i \\\\ln \\\\frac{1}{\\\\eta_i}\\n$$\\n\\nFor the Bell states of we find then:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\hat{\\\\rho_B}_1 = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left( \\\\left|H\\\\right\\\\rangle\\\\left\\\\langle H\\\\right| + \\\\left|V\\\\right\\\\rangle\\\\left\\\\langle V\\\\right| \\\\right)\\n$$\\n\\nIts corresponding entropy is $S=\\\\ln 2$, the entropy of a\\npure state is $S=0$.\\n\\n# Back to the correlation between distant photons\\n\\nIn the last sections we performed measurements on joined detection\\nprobabilities between two independent polarizers. Quite importantly we\\nsaw that:\\n\\n- Each photon is in a superposition of\\n  $\\\\left|H\\\\right\\\\rangle$ and\\n  $\\\\left|V\\\\right\\\\rangle$.\\n\\n- Both photons are always detected in the same polarization state.\\n\\n- From Fig. [2](#fig-polar-anal) it\\n  seems as if 1 was a bit closer to the source than 2 [^1]. So 1 is\\n  detected a bit earlier and projected onto one of the two states.\\n\\n- Yet, 2 seems to instantaneously on which polarization 1 was\\n  projected and choses the same one.\\n\\nFor our set-up the distances are small, but the same observations and\\narguments hold also for very large distances between the detectors.\\nEinstein, Podolski and Rosen understood this long distance correlation\\nand decided that something was funky about quantum mechanics\\n[@Einstein_1935].\\n\\nTherefore, the idea of an additional hidden shared parameter can be\\nintroduced to explain the correlations between distant objects. We will\\nsimply assume that the two photons have well-defined polarization with\\nangle $\\\\lambda$ from the starting point, yet this polarization varies\\nrandomly from pair to pair between 0 and $2\\\\pi$. Hence we have uniform\\nprobability distribution $\\\\rho(\\\\lambda) = \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi}$. The\\nmeasurement of the polarizers can then simply be modelled through\\n\\n$$\\nA_{hv}(\\\\lambda, \\\\theta) =\\\\text{sign}\\\\left(\\\\cos2 (\\\\theta-\\\\lambda)\\\\right)\\n$$\\n\\nThis model reproduces nicely all the tests that we ran\\npreviously. Namely, maximum detection for HH and VV as well as zero\\ncorrelation for $HV$. They can be nicely compared through the\\ncorrelation coefficient $E(\\\\theta_1,\\\\theta_2)$. The particularly\\nperturbing case is that this simple model for hidden parameters works\\neven perfectly well in the case of $45^\\\\circ$ angles. So is there any\\nmeasurable difference between our observations and the hidden variable\\nmodels ?\\n\\n<figure id=\\"fig-corr\\">\\n<img src=\\"./lecture12_pic4.png\\" width=\\"70%\\" />\\n<figcaption>Correlation coefficient as taken from  <a href=\\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/introduction-to-quantum-optics/F45DCE785DC8226D4156EC15CAD5FA9A\\">Grynberg</a>.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n# Bell's theorem\\n\\nBell posed the previous discussion on a more general and quite simple\\nfooting [Bell 1964](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/physicsphysiquefizika.1.195) and later extended by [Clauser, Horner, Shimony, Holt](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/physrevlett.23.880).

A first discussion of the different\\napproaches can be found in chapter 10 of [Hertel 2015](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-54322-7_10). The different\\nlevels of sophistication are:\\n\\n- The _Thomas-Fermi_ model, which assumes that the $N$ electrons\\n  behave like a Fermi gas inside the $Z/r$ potential.\\n\\n- The Hartree method, in which the effective potential is iteratively\\n  recalculated based on the obtained solutions to the radial\\n  Schrödinger equation.\\n\\n- The Hartree Fock method, in which we also take into account the\\n  proper symmetrization of the wavefunctions.\\n\\n# Filling up the shells\\n\\nIf we can ignore the spin for the determination of the energy levels, we\\nhave the following quantum numbers:\\n\\n- $n$, which is electron shell.\\n\\n- $l$, which is the orbital angular momentum with $l<n$.\\n\\n- $s$, which is the spin of the electron and it can be $\\\\pm 1/2$\\n\\nAs the electrons are fermions we can fill up each of the $nl$ states\\nwith two of them. We then write down the configuration of the electron\\nby writing down the numbers of electrons per $nl$ configuration. So we\\nget the periodic table shown in Fig. [5](#783282){reference-type=\\"ref\\"\\nreference=\\"783282\\"}. We will typically use the following notation:\\n\\n- A _configuration_ is the distribution of the electrons over the\\n  different orbits.\\n\\n- Electrons with the same $n$ are part of the same _shell_.\\n\\n- Electrons with the same $n$ and $l$ are part of the same\\n  _sub-shell_.\\n\\n- The inner shells are typically filled and form the _core_.\\n\\n- The outermost shell is typically named the _valence_ shell.\\n\\n<figure id=\\"fig-measure\\">\\n<img src=\\"./lecture13_pic5.png\\" width=\\"70%\\" />\\n<figcaption>Periodic table as taken from <a href=\\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Detailiertes_Periodensystem_mit_Elektronenkonfiguration.png\\">wiki commons</a> </figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n# Alkali Atoms\\n\\nAlkali atoms are the simplest to understand and widely used in the field\\nof laser cooling. The electron configurations are\\n\\n#### Examples.\\n\\n- $\\\\mathrm{Li}$: 1s$^2$ 2s\\n\\n- $\\\\mathrm{Na}$:\\n  1s$^2$ 2s$^2$ 2p$^6$ 3s\\n\\n- $\\\\mathrm{K}$:\\n  1s$^2$ 2s$^2$ 2p$^6$ 3s$^2$ 3p$^6$ 4s,\\n  so we fill up the 4s orbitals before the 3d orbitals.\\n\\n- $\\\\mathrm{Rb}$:\\n  1s$^2$ 2s$^2$ 2p$^6$ 3s$^2$ 3p$^6$ 3d$^{10}$ 4s$^2$ 4p$^6$ 5s,\\n  so we fill up the 5s orbitals before the 4d and 4f orbitals.\\n\\n- $\\\\mathrm{Cs}$:\\n  1s$^2$ 2s$^2$ 2p$^6$ 3s$^2$ 3p$^6$ 3d$^{10}$ 4s$^2$ 4p$^6$ 4d$^{10}$ 5s$^{2}$ 5p$^6$ 6s,\\n  so we fill up the 6s orbitals before the 4f, 5d and 5f orbitals.\\n\\nThis structure can be nicely understood by the idea of screening as\\nintroduced in the central field approximation. Consider for example the\\n$\\\\mathrm{Na}$ for which one electron has to be on the third shell.\\nWithin the hydrogen atom the 3s, 3p and 3d are degenerate, however the\\nscreening will lift this degeneracy.\\n\\n- Electrons in the s-shell spend a lot of time close to the nucleus\\n  and fill a strong binding potential, i.e. they have a low energy.\\n\\n- On the other extreme the electrons in the d-shell have large angular\\n  momentum, which hinders them from getting close to the core. The 10\\n  electrons can therefore efficiently screen the nucleus from the\\n  electron. The energy of the d shell is therefore quite close to the\\n  energy of the hydrogen atom.\\n\\nFor $\\\\mathrm{K}$ the same principle applies.\\n\\n- The 4s orbital is strongly shifted down to the strong nuclear\\n  potential.\\n\\n- The 3d orbital is well screened by the other electrons, such that it\\n  is of higher energy than the 4s orbit.\\n\\nWe can describe this effect empirically through the _quantum defect_. We\\nsimply write down the energy levels as:\\n\\n$$\\nE_{nl} \\\\cong -  R_{y,\\\\infty} \\\\cdot \\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{n-\\\\delta_l} \\\\right)^2,\\n$$\\n\\nwhere $\\\\delta_l$ is the quantum defect for a certain\\nvalue of $l$. Some examples are summarized in Fig.\\n[6](#fig-quantum-defect).\\n\\n<figure id=\\"fig-quantum-defect\\">\\n<img src=\\"./lecture13_pic6.png\\" width=\\"70%\\" />\\n<figcaption>The quantum defect for different alkali atoms.

For a\\nsingle outer electron, we have even seen how this screening can be\\ndescribed by the quantum defect.\\n\\nWe would now like to go beyond this simple picture and discuss the\\nfollowing questions:\\n\\n- How should the residual term $\\\\hat{H}_1$ be taken into account?\\n\\n- How do we properly take into account the Pauli principle ?\\n\\n- How can we treat the fine-splitting ?\\n\\n# On the residual coupling\\n\\nIf we ignore the residual coupling, we obtain a spherically symmetric\\nproblem, which implies that the angular momentum $\\\\vec{l}_i$ of each\\nelectron is conserved. This conservation will be broken by\\n$\\\\hat{H}_{1}$. However, these forces are internal, which implies that\\nthe total angular momentum $\\\\vec{L} = \\\\sum_i \\\\vec{l}_i$ is conserved. So\\nwe should label the states in the complex Hamiltonian by $\\\\vec{L}$.\\n\\nThe total angular momentum will then set the symmetry of the spatial\\nwavefunction. As already discussed in some detail for the He atom, this\\nhas wide-reaching consquence on the spin degree of freedom through\\nexchange interaction.\\n\\n# The Pauli principle and spin\\n\\n- According to the Pauli principle, each single-particle state can be\\n  occupied only by one electron. After distributing all electrons over\\n  different single-particle eigenstates (\\"orbitals\\"), the resulting\\n  state needs to be fully antisymmetrized (Slater determinant).\\n\\n- There is a simplification for atoms with many electrons: The angular\\n  momenta and spins of a complete subshell with\\n  $n,\\\\,l,\\\\,\\\\{m_{-l},\\\\cdots,m_l\\\\}$ add to zero and can be ignored in\\n  the further considerations (\\"shell structure\\"). Note that this is\\n  often broken in molecular binding!\\n\\n- Alkali atoms are the simplest atoms with shell structure: All but\\n  one _valence_ electron add to $L=0,S=0$. The ground state thus has\\n  $L=0,S=1/2$.\\n\\n- For more complex atoms, the valence electrons couple to a total\\n  orbital angular momentum $L$ with a given symmetry according to\\n  particle exchange.\\n\\nLet us have a look at two examples for light atoms, starting with\\n$\\\\mathrm{He}$:\\n\\n- $1s^2 \\\\rightarrow L=0,S=0$. The corresponding term is $^1S$\\n\\n- $1s2s \\\\rightarrow L=0, \\\\{S=0,S=1\\\\}$. The corresponding terms are\\n  $^1S$ and $^3S$. .\\n\\nThe electronic configuration of $\\\\mathrm{Si}$ is:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\underbrace{1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2}_{L=0,\\\\,S=0} 3p^2\\n$$\\n\\nPer valence electron we have $l=1$ and $s=1/2$. So we\\nget $L=0,1,2$ and $S=0,1$. Here $S=1$ means symmetry and $S=0$\\nantisymmetry with respect to particle exchange. In principle we can form\\nthe following terms:\\n\\n$$\\n^1 S, ^3 S, ^1 P, ^3 P,^1 D,^3 D\\n$$\\n\\nWhich of these terms can be fully antisymmetrized? Here,\\nonly the terms $^1S$, $^3P$ and $^1D$ fulfill Pauli's principle. In\\ngeneral the exchange interaction (seen in the discussion of He), will\\nthen lower the energy of the states with high spins.\\n\\n## Optional: Symmetry of the $L$ states\\n\\nWe can construct the following $L$-states for them:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\left|L=2,M_L=2\\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\left|\\\\overbrace{1^{l_1},\\\\overbrace{1}^{m_{l_1}};\\\\overbrace{1}^{l_2},\\\\overbrace{1}^{m_{l_2}}}\\\\right\\\\rangle\\n$$\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\left|L=1,M_L=0\\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} ( \\\\left|\\\\overbrace{1^{m_{l_1}},\\\\overbrace{-1}^{m_{l_2}}}\\\\right\\\\rangle - \\\\left|-1,1 )\\\\right\\\\rangle\\n$$\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\left|L=0,M_L=0\\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{3}}(\\\\left|\\\\overbrace{1^{m_{l_1}},\\\\overbrace{-1}^{m_{l_2}}}\\\\right\\\\rangle - \\\\left|0,0\\\\right\\\\rangle + \\\\left|-1,1\\\\right\\\\rangle )\\n$$\\n\\nThe first and third states are symmetric and the second state is antisymmetric with respect to particle\\nexchange.\\n\\n# Fine splitting\\n\\nWe have already seen in the discussion of the hydrogen atom that\\nrelativistic effects should be taken into account to fully understand\\nthe level spectrum of different atoms. To take into account the spin, we\\ncan decompose the Hamiltonian as follows:\\n\\n$$\\n\\n\\\\hat{H} = \\\\underbrace{\\\\sum_i^N \\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\vec{\\\\nabla}^2_{\\\\vec{r}_i} + V_\\\\textrm{cf} (r_i) \\\\right)}_{\\\\hat{H}_0} + \\\\underbrace{\\\\sum^N_{j>i} \\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{r_{ij}} - S(r_i) \\\\right)}_{\\\\hat{H}_1} + \\\\underbrace{\\\\sum_i^N c_i(\\\\vec{r}_i) \\\\hat{\\\\vec{L}}_i \\\\cdot \\\\hat{\\\\vec{S}}_i}_{\\\\hat{H}_2}\\n$$\\n\\nThe term $\\\\hat{H}_0$ is from the central field and the\\nindependent particle model. The Hamiltonian $\\\\hat{H}_1$ results from the\\nresidual electrostatic interaction and the Hamiltonian $\\\\hat{H}_2$ comes\\nfrom the spin-orbit coupling of individual electrons.\\n\\nThe question is now which term dominates. Since\\n$\\\\hat{H}_2 \\\\propto (Z\\\\alpha)^2$, we can ignore it if $Z$ is small. This\\nis the case for light atoms.\\n\\nFor our example this means that $^3P$ is the lowest energy state.\\nHowever, the triplet state has a multiplicity. Which are these states?\\nThere has to be an additional degree of freedom. The total electronic\\nangular momentum $\\\\hat{\\\\vec{J}} = \\\\hat{\\\\vec{L}} + \\\\hat{\\\\vec{S}}$ of the\\natom is a conserved quantity. The basis\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\left|L,S,M_\\\\textrm{l},M_\\\\textrm{s}\\\\right\\\\rangle\\n$$\\n\\nis therefore not the right basis, since $M_\\\\textrm{l}$\\nand $M_\\\\textrm{s}$ are not conserved because of $LS$ coupling. The\\ncorrect basis is\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\left|L,S,J,M_\\\\textrm{j}\\\\right\\\\rangle.\\n$$\\n\\nWhich $J$ corresponds to the ground state? If the\\noutermost shell is more than half filled, the maximum $J$ value is the\\nground state, otherwise, the ground state has the minimum $J$ value. In\\nour example, $\\\\mathrm{Si}$: $^3P_0$ is the ground state!\\n\\nSo far, we have been concerned with the \\"Russell-Saunders\\" coupling,\\nalso known as $LS$ coupling. However, for atoms with large $Z$, the term\\n$\\\\hat{H}_2$ in the Hamiltonian might become large, since it is\\nproportional to $(Z \\\\alpha)^2$. We can ignore $\\\\hat{H}_1$ instead.\\n\\nAccording to $\\\\hat{H}_2$ the individual electron orbital angular\\nmomentum $l$ pairs with the spin $s$ of the same electron to form the\\ntotal electron angular momentum $j$. This will lead us to the concept of\\n$jj$ coupling. Let us consider carbon first (see\\n[1](#693186){reference-type=\\"ref\\" reference=\\"693186\\"}). The ground state\\nreads:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\mathrm{C}: 1s^22s^22p^2.\\n$$\\n\\nLet us consider one excited state:\\n\\n$$\\n1s^22s^22p3s.\\n$$\\n\\n<figure id=\\"fig-ineff\\">\\n<img src=\\"./lecture14_pic1.png\\" width=\\"70%\\" />\\n</figure>\\n\\nIn the figure above \\"The splitting of levels in the first excited $^1$ P and $^3$P terms of\\nthe carbon sequence.

Thus, we should\\nexpect a singlet and a triplet. For heavy atoms we can observe two\\ndoublets instead of a singlet and a triplet.

The nucleus has the same, such that we have $I=1/2$ and\\nthe groundstate splits into the $F=0$ and the $F=1$ doublet. They are\\nseparated by an energy difference of $1.42$GHz. This corresponds to a\\ntransition wavelength of 21 cm, which is widely used in astronomy.\\n\\n## Cesium clocks\\n\\nThe definition of time is based the hyperfine levels of Cs. Cs has just\\none stable isotope Cs-133 with nuclear spin $I=7/2$. The ground state\\nelectron is in the the 6s state in the $^2 S_{1/2}$ state. So the\\ngroundstate splits into the $F=3$ and $F=4$ manifold. They are separated\\nby 9.4GHz and the clicking between these transitions is our definition\\nof time. The second is actually [defined as](https://www.physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/current.html):\\n\\n> The second is the duration of 9 192 631 770 periods of the radiation\\n> corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of\\n> the ground state of the cesium 133 atom.\\n\\nAll the other units have similiar definitions, except the embarrising\\nkilogram. It is defined as:\\n\\n> The kilogram is the unit of mass; it is equal to the mass of the\\n> international prototype of the kilogram.\\n\\nThis will change soon as the member states of _Bureau International des\\nPoids et des Mesures_ decided to base the SI system on the measurement\\nof fundamental constants instead of some prototypes. So, now the\\nfundamental constants will have no errorbars left, as shown in Fig.\\n[2](#fig-si-units).\\n\\n<figure id=\\"fig-si-units\\">\\n<img src=\\"./lecture14_pic2.png\\" width=\\"95%\\" />\\n<figcaption>This wallet card displays the fundamental constants and other physical values that will define a revised international system of units.

For example we have two different\\nstable isotope of Li, namely Li $^6$ and Li$^7$, which only differ by one\\nneutron in the nucleus. All the wavelengths for controlling the atoms\\nare extremely similiar, however the hyperfine structure is different.\\nFor Li$^6$ we have a nuclear spin of $I=1$ and for Li$^7$ $I=3/2$. The\\nresulting total angular momentum\\n\\n- $F=1/2$ in the ground state of Li$^6$\\n\\n- $F=1$ in the ground state of Li$^7$\\n\\nSo one is of them is an integer spin boson and the other one is a spin\\nhalf fermion. One can nicely see these differences as one tries to put\\nthem onto each other for cold temperatures and tight traps as visualized\\nin the Figure below and reproduced from [Truscott 2001](http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1059318).\\n\\n<figure id=\\"fig-fermi\\">\\n<img src=\\"./lecture14_pic3.png\\" width=\\"95%\\" />\\n</figure>","order":14},{"title":"Lecture 15 - Diatomic molecules","content":"\\nIn this lecture we will start to put atoms together to build simple\\nmolecules. We will first use the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, to\\neliminate slow processes from the study of the fast electron dynamics.\\nThen, we will study simple mechanisms of binding atoms.\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nMolecules add a new layer of complexity to the system. In atoms, we had\\ndifferent combinations of nuclei and electrons, leading to different\\nkinds of atoms. In this lecture, we will use atoms as basic building\\nblock of more complex structures, the molecules. While this complexity\\nmakes it necessary to introduce new approximations, it also allows us to\\nstudy new processes in nature.\\n\\nSo we will start out with the simplest of all molecules, barely a\\nmolecule, the $H_2^+$ ion. We start out with a discussion of the\\nBorn-Oppenheimer approximation. Detailled discussions can be found in\\n[Chapter 8 of Atkins](https://books.google.de/books?id=9KEPAQAAMAAJ), [Chapter 9 of Demtröder](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-10298-1) and\\n[Chapter 10 of Bransden](https://books.google.de/books?id=i5IPWXDQlcIC).\\n\\n# Molecular hydrogen ion\\n\\nIn molecular hydrogen we have only three ingredients. A single electron,\\nwhich is bound to two nuclei as shown in Fig.\\n[1](#fig-hydrogen-ion).\\n\\n<figure id=\\"fig-hydrogen-ion\\">\\n<img src=\\"./lecture15_pic1.png\\" width=\\"95%\\" />\\n<figcaption>The molecular hydrogen ion as discussed in the main text.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\nThe full Hamiltonian of the system at study would read:\\n\\n$$\\\\hat{H} = - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\nabla_\\\\mathbf{r}^2 - \\\\frac{1}{2M}\\\\left(\\\\nabla_{\\\\mathbf{R}_\\\\mathrm{A}}^2 +\\\\nabla_{\\\\mathbf{R}_\\\\mathrm{B}}^2\\\\right) + V(\\\\mathbf{r}, \\\\mathbf{R}_\\\\mathrm{A}, \\\\mathbf{R}_\\\\mathrm{B})$$\\nWe will further introduce the short-hand notations:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\hat{T}_e = - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\nabla_\\\\mathbf{r}^2 \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\hat{T}_n = - \\\\frac{1}{2M}\\\\left(\\\\nabla_{\\\\mathbf{R}_\\\\mathrm{A}}^2 +\\\\nabla_{\\\\mathbf{R}_\\\\mathrm{B}}^2\\\\right)\\n$$\\n\\nIn a stark difference to atoms, we now have two charged nuclei. The\\nrelative distance between them and between the electron will be of major\\nimportance. Most importantly, we should answer the question, why this\\nconfiguration should be stable at all given that the two protons repel\\neach other. To handle the problem, we will once again separate out\\nenergy scales.\\n\\n## The Born-Oppenheimer approximation\\n\\nThe idea of the **Born-Oppenheimer approximation** is to separate the\\nfast electronic motion from the slow motion of the heavy nuclueus\\n($M=1836$). So we will\\n\\n1.  Solve the electronic motion with the nuclear coordinates fixed.\\n\\n2.  Solve the nuclear motion, assuming that the electron wavefunction\\n    adapts instantaneously.\\n\\nSo the ansatz is:\\n$$\\\\Psi(\\\\mathbf{R}_\\\\mathrm{A}, \\\\mathbf{R}_\\\\mathrm{B}, \\\\mathbf{r}) = \\\\psi_e(\\\\mathbf{R}_\\\\mathrm{A}, \\\\mathbf{R}_\\\\mathrm{B}, \\\\mathbf{r})\\\\cdot \\\\psi_n(\\\\mathbf{R}_\\\\mathrm{A}, \\\\mathbf{R}_\\\\mathrm{B})$$\\n\\nWe will plug this into the Schrödinger equation to obtain:\\n$$\\\\psi_n\\\\hat{T}_e\\\\psi_e +\\\\psi_e\\\\hat{T}_n\\\\psi_n + V(\\\\mathbf{r}, \\\\mathbf{R}_\\\\mathrm{A}, \\\\mathbf{R}_\\\\mathrm{B})\\\\psi_e \\\\psi_n + W = E \\\\psi_e\\\\psi_n$$\\n\\nThis transformation introduced the _non-adiabatic_ effects:\\n$$W = -\\\\frac{1}{2M}\\\\sum_{i=A,B} \\\\left[(\\\\nabla_{\\\\mathbf{R}_i}\\\\psi_e)\\\\cdot(\\\\nabla_{\\\\mathbf{R}_i}\\\\psi_n)+\\\\psi_n \\\\nabla_{\\\\mathbf{R}_i}^2 \\\\psi_e\\\\right]$$\\n\\nIn the following we will neglect these effects. And obtain:\\n$$\\\\psi_e \\\\hat{T}_n\\\\psi_n + \\\\left(\\\\hat{T}_e\\\\psi_e+V\\\\psi_e\\\\right)\\\\psi_n = E \\\\psi_e\\\\psi_n$$\\nSo we will first solve the _electronic motion_:\\n$$\\\\left(\\\\hat{T}_e+\\\\hat{V}\\\\right)\\\\psi_e = E_e(\\\\mathbf{R}_\\\\mathrm{A}, \\\\mathbf{R}_\\\\mathrm{B}) \\\\psi_e$$\\nTo be explicit we obtain for the ionic hydrogen:\\n\\n$$\\n\\nH_e = -\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\nabla_\\\\mathbf{r}^2-\\\\frac{1}{r_A}-\\\\frac{1}{r_B}+\\\\frac{1}{R}\\n$$\\n\\nAt this stage we can just focus on the electronic part to understand the\\nstructure of simple diatomic molecules, while assuming that $R$ is an\\nindependent parameter. Most importantly, we will focus at usual on\\nsymmetries, which will tell us more about the allowed states in the\\nsystem.\\n\\nIn the second step we will solve the nuclear motion:\\n$$\\\\hat{T}_n\\\\psi_n + E_e \\\\psi_n = E \\\\psi_n$$\\n\\nThis nuclear motion will be at the origin of rotational and vibrational\\nlevels, which will be discussed in on of the next lectures.\\n\\n# Symmetries of the electronic wavefunction\\n\\nThis discussion follows along similiar lines as for the hydrogen atom\\nand the helium atom. We basically can categorize the different states by\\ntheir properties. This will help us later enormously to understand\\nallowed transition etc.\\n\\n## Angular momentum\\n\\nFor any (diatomic) molecule we break the spherical symmetry that we\\nrelied on for the atomic systems. This means that angular momentum is\\nnot a conserved quantity anymore.\\n\\nHowever, the full Hamiltonian is invariant under the rotation around the\\naxis of the diatomic molecule. One can verify that this implies that:\\n\\n$$\\n[H_e, L_z] = 0\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\Rightarrow L_z \\\\psi_e = \\\\pm \\\\Lambda \\\\psi_e (a.u.)\\n$$\\n\\nThe reason is that\\n$\\\\hat{L}_z =\\\\frac{1}{i}\\\\partial_\\\\varphi$ depends solely on the angle\\n$\\\\varphi$ and not on $R$. Here the quantum number can have the integer\\nvalues $\\\\Lambda= 0, 1, 2 , \\\\cdots$. We also note them\\n$\\\\Sigma, \\\\Pi, \\\\Delta, \\\\Phi$ or $\\\\sigma, \\\\pi, \\\\delta, \\\\phi$ for single\\nelectrons.\\n\\n## Parity\\n\\nWe further have symmetry under parity operation for _homo-nuclear,\\ndiatomic_ molecules $A_2$. This means that we have once more:\\n$$\\\\hat{P}\\\\psi_e(\\\\mathbf{r}) = \\\\pm\\\\psi_e(\\\\mathbf{r})$$ In the same way as\\nin the lecture on the Helium atom we distinguish the states by _gerade_\\nand _ungerade_. So we then end up with something like\\n$\\\\Lambda_{u,g}^\\\\pm$.\\n\\n## Spin\\n\\nIf the system does not have explicit spin-orbit coupling, the total spin\\n$S$ of the system will be conserved. So the full notation for electronic\\nstates is typically: $$^{2S+1}\\\\Lambda^{\\\\pm}_{g,u}$$ Most of the time the\\nground state of the system is $^{1}\\\\Sigma^{+}_{g}$.\\n\\n# Stability of the ground state molecule\\n\\nWe have now studied the symmetries that the system should have, but\\nuntil now we did not discuss the most important question: Is this\\nmolecule stable ? Within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, we can\\nactually solve the ionic hydrogen molecule analytically (see [Chapter 9 of\\nDemtröder](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-10298-1)). The resulting **molecular potential curves** are\\nshown in Fig. [2](#fig-potentials).\\n\\n<figure id=\\"fig-potentials\\">\\n<img src=\\"./lecture15_pic2.png\\" width=\\"60%\\" />\\n<figcaption>Molecular potential curves for the molecular hydrogen ion. Figure is\\ntaken from <a href=\\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/molecular-quantum-mechanics-9780199541423\\">here</a>.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n## Linear combination of atomic orbitals\\n\\nThe analytical solutions are rather bulky and not particularly\\ninstructive. One powerful idea, and very good approximation, is to\\ndecompose the molecule wavefunction over the atomic orbitals of its\\ncomponents. Going back to Fig. [1](#fig-hydrogen-ion) we could make the simple Ansatz:\\n$$\\\\psi_e(\\\\mathbf{r})= c_1 \\\\psi_{1s}(\\\\mathbf{r}_\\\\mathrm{A})+c_2 \\\\psi_{1s}(\\\\mathbf{r}_\\\\mathrm{B})$$\\n\\nNote, that we made a very simple Ansatz at this stage and we could\\ndecompose the system over a much larger set of excited states. But for\\npedagogical reason we will stick to the simple model at this stage.\\nGoing through the symmetry requirements, we find that we can write the\\nfull wavefunction as:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\psi_{g,u}(\\\\mathbf{r})= \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pm2S}}\\\\left(\\\\psi_{1s}(\\\\mathbf{r}_\\\\mathrm{A})\\\\pm \\\\psi_{1s}(\\\\mathbf{r}_\\\\mathrm{B})\\\\right)\\n$$\\n\\nThe contribution $S$ describes the overlap of the two atomic orbitals\\n$$S =  \\\\int d\\\\mathbf{r}\\\\psi_{1s}^*(\\\\mathbf{r}_\\\\mathrm{A})\\\\psi_{1s}(\\\\mathbf{r}_\\\\mathrm{B})$$\\nWe can then evaluate the energy of the two states through the\\nvariational principle:\\n\\n$$\\nE_{g,u} = \\\\left\\\\langle\\\\psi_{g,u}\\\\right|\\\\hat{H}_e\\\\left|\\\\psi_{g,u}\\\\right\\\\rangle\\\\\\\\\\n = \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pm2S}\\\\left(\\\\left\\\\langle\\\\psi_A\\\\right|\\\\pm \\\\left\\\\langle\\\\psi_B\\\\right|\\\\right)\\\\hat{H}_e\\\\left(\\\\left|\\\\psi_A\\\\right\\\\rangle\\\\pm \\\\left|\\\\psi_B\\\\right\\\\rangle\\\\right)\\\\\\\\\\n = \\\\frac{E_{AA}\\\\pm E_{AB}}{1\\\\pm S}\\\\\\\\\\n$$\\n\\nThe resulting energy surfaces are shown in Fig. [3](#fig-lcao). In the most\\nsimplistic interpretation the gerade state does not have a node in the\\nmiddle and it is therefore of smaller kinetic energy.\\n\\n<figure id=\\"fig-lcao\\">\\n<img src=\\"./lecture15_pic3.svg\\" width=\\"70%\\" />\\n<figcaption>The energy surface of the LCAO for the hydrogen molecule ion.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n# The neutral hydrogen molecule\\n\\nIn the previous section we have seen how we can treat the coupling of\\nthe nuclei through the exchange of a single shared electron. However, we\\nshould now move on to the case of two neutral particles binding\\ntogether. What is here the relevant mechanism ?\\n\\n<figure id=\\"fig-hydrogen\\">\\n<img src=\\"./lecture15_pic4.svg\\" width=\\"70%\\" />\\n<figcaption>The hydrogen molecule.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\nIn the following we will only consider the electronic part, which adds\\nup too:\\n\\n$$\\\\hat{H} = -\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left(\\\\nabla_{\\\\mathbf{r}_1}^2+\\\\nabla_{\\\\mathbf{r}_2}^2\\\\right)-\\\\frac{1}{r_{A1}}-\\\\frac{1}{r_{A2}}-\\\\frac{1}{r_{B1}}-\\\\frac{1}{r_{B2}}+\\\\frac{1}{r_{12}}+\\\\frac{1}{R}$$\\n\\nWe can now rewrite this Hamiltonian in the more instructive form\\n\\n$$\\n\\n\\\\hat{H} = H_{0,1}+H_{0,2}+\\\\frac{1}{r_{12}}+\\\\frac{1}{R}\\\\\\\\\\nH_{0,i} = -\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\nabla_{\\\\mathbf{r}_i}^2-\\\\frac{1}{r_{A,i}}-\\\\frac{1}{r_{B,i}}\\n\\n\\n$$\\n\\nWe have can now use the results of the hydrogen ion to understand this\\nsystem.\\n\\n- We have for each electron the solution of hydrogen molecule ion.\\n- In the next step, we have to put the two electrons properly within\\n  this orbit with $S=0$ and _ignoring_ the $e^-$ - $e^-$ interaction.\\n\\nSo we can make the Ansatz:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{r}_1, \\\\mathbf{r}_2) = \\\\psi_{g}(\\\\mathbf{r}_1)\\\\cdot\\\\psi_{g}(\\\\mathbf{r}_2)\\\\\\\\\\n= \\\\frac{1}{2 + 2S}\\\\left(\\\\psi_{1s}(\\\\mathbf{r}_{A1})+\\\\psi_{1s}(\\\\mathbf{r}_{B1})\\\\right)\\\\left(\\\\psi_{1s}(\\\\mathbf{r}_{A2})+\\\\psi_{1s}(\\\\mathbf{r}_{B2})\\\\right)\\\\\\\\\\n= \\\\frac{1}{2 + 2S}\\\\left(\\\\psi_{1s}(\\\\mathbf{r}_{A1})\\\\psi_{1s}(\\\\mathbf{r}_{B2})+\\\\psi_{1s}(\\\\mathbf{r}_{B1})\\\\psi_{1s}(\\\\mathbf{r}_{A2}) +\\\\psi_{1s}(\\\\mathbf{r}_{A1})\\\\psi_{1s}(\\\\mathbf{r}_{A2})+\\\\psi_{1s}(\\\\mathbf{r}_{B1})\\\\psi_{1s}(\\\\mathbf{r}_{B2}) \\\\right)\\n$$\\n\\nThe first two terms describe **kovalent binding**. They\\ndescribe situations where each electron is associated with one core. The\\nlast two terms describe **ionic binding** as one associated both\\nelectrons with a single atom and then looks one the attraction of\\nanother ionic core. This is quite similiar to the interaction in the\\n$H_2^+$ molecule.\\n\\nWithin this approach, one actually finds a binding energy of\\n$E_b = {-2.64}\\\\text{eV}$ at an equilibrium distance of $R_e = 1.4 a_0$.\\nThe experimentally measured values differs quite substantially as we\\nhave $E_b = {-4.7}\\\\text{eV}$. A substantial approximation was here that we\\nneglected the interaction between the electrons, which should repel.\\n\\n## The Heitler-London method\\n\\nAs the two electrons should repel each other, we can assume that the\\nionic binding is strongly suppressed. So the wavefunction is now assumed\\nto be:\\n\\n$$\\n\\n\\\\psi_{HL} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2 + 2S^2}}\\\\left(\\\\psi_{1s}(\\\\mathbf{r}_{A1})\\\\psi_{1s}(\\\\mathbf{r}_{B2})+\\\\psi_{1s}(\\\\mathbf{r}_{B1})\\\\psi_{1s}(\\\\mathbf{r}_{A2})\\\\right)\\n$$\\n\\nAgain, the wavefunction cannot be factorized and the two\\nelectrons are entangled because of the interactions. Recognize the\\ncommon theme with the Helium atom. Calculation of the binding energy\\nwithin this approximation leads to $E_b = {-3.14}\\\\text{eV}$ and\\n$R_e=1.6a_0$.\\n\\nIn the next lecture we will discuss how we can move on\\nfrom these extremely simple diatomic molecules to the assembly of richer\\nsystems.","order":15}]`);export{e as b};
