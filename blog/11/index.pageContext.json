The scene includes one or more users interacting with the interface—viewing images, clicking buttons, scrolling the gallery, or using the image generation input at the top. The users are shown from behind or in profile, seated at modern desks or standing at digital kiosks, with screens reflecting soft light. Each artwork is presented as a card with options like zoom, download, share, and delete. The environment hints at a creative, tech-savvy atmosphere—possibly a home studio, co-working space, or minimalist digital art lab. UI elements include Ethereum wallet icons, NFT badges, and interactive controls. Subtle hints at future features like comment icons, user profiles, or DAO governance panels are also visible.\n\nStyle & Details:\n\n    UI mockup meets concept art with human interaction\n\n    Modern techwear or casual clothing for users\n\n    Clean, bright interface with slight neon accents\n\n    Glass panels, soft gradients, glowing edges\n\n    Inspiration: OpenSea, futuristic art apps, virtual gallery spaces\""}},"prevBlog":{"title":"Updates to the website","content":"","type":"react","publishing_date":"2025-05-26","order":"!undefined","tokenID":26,"description":"I explore my website's evolution over 6 months, from minimal CSS to Panda CSS and Copilot refactoring.

The website uses clean, consistent styling with a hint of Panda CSS’s design aesthetic—modular, colorful but minimal, developer-friendly. Several people from diverse backgrounds (varying in age, gender, ethnicity, ability) are actively interacting with the interface: one person reviewing lecture notes, another browsing AI-generated images, a third writing or refactoring code using GitHub Copilot Agent Mode. One user scrolls through a blog post feed, while another manages content tags or explores settings for automatic image deletion.\n\nThe environment is creative and tech-forward—an open workspace or a cozy developer studio with large screens, personal items like coffee mugs or headphones, and soft lighting. Screens display snippets of code, markdown content, AI-generated visuals, and metadata tags. The overall feel is exploratory and productive, highlighting human-AI collaboration and open web development.\n\nVisual Style:\n\n    Tech-meets-creativity vibe\n\n    Clear web UI elements (lecture notes section, image generator, blog tag editor)\n\n    Glowing soft interface panels with code and markdown\n\n    Friendly, casual modern clothing for users\n\n    Diverse individuals collaborating or exploring alone\""}},"nextBlog":{"title":"A public gallery of AI generated images","content":"","type":"react","publishing_date":"2025-06-18","order":"!undefined","tokenID":23,"description":"I create a privacy-focused AI image gallery where creators share work and collectors mint NFTs.
