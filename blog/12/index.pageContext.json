On the screen you can see a minimalistic and modern web interface showcasing a public gallery of AI-generated digital artworks. The layout includes a grid of diverse, visually striking AI images with vibrant colors and imaginative content. Each image has a subtle overlay with a “Collect” button and a visible price tag in ETH (e.g., “0.004 ETH”). The interface features tabs or filters at the top (\"Private\", \"Public Gallery\") and a clean, minimalist design. Aesthetic style is a blend of futuristic and artistic. Include small indicators like wallet icons or user avatars for creators.
