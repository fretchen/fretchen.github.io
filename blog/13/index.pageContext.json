The table displays an interactive digital map or dashboard showing shared fishing zones, fish stock data, and boat icons representing different levels of fishing effort. Charts and visual indicators show options like ‚Äú1 Boat - Sustainable,‚Äù ‚Äú8 Boats - Moderate,‚Äù and ‚Äú16 Boats - Intensive.‚Äù One of the female chiefs loosely resembles the Moana character from the Disney movie.\n\nThe chiefs are actively interacting with the shared governance interface, discussing or pointing at various strategies: market solutions (üí∞), state authority (üèõÔ∏è), and community-based governance (ü§ù). One screen panel shows ‚ÄúOstrom‚Äôs Design Principles,‚Äù while another reveals simulation results and resource regeneration curves. Subtle elements like voting tokens, tokens of redistribution, or community rulebooks suggest collaboration and tradeoffs.\n\nThe environment is a blend of tradition and technology‚Äîa council hut or open-air structure with tablets, floating screens, and hand-drawn fishing maps.
