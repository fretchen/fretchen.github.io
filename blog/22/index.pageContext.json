One robot (the “buyer”) sends an HTTP request bubble labeled “POST /genimg”, receives a playful “402 Payment Required” sign, then hands over a glowing crypto coin labeled “USDC”. A third character, a smiling facilitator robot, verifies the payment and passes it along to a stylized blockchain cloud labeled “Optimism L2”. In the final panel, an image and NFT certificate pop out with sparkles. Soft pastel colors, clean line art, minimalistic tech icons, flat design, bright and optimistic mood, modern web3 aesthetic, no dark tones.\""}},"prevBlog":{"title":"How bots exploited my ImageGen contract - and how I fixed it","content":"","type":"react","publishing_date":"2025-12-02","order":"!undefined","tokenID":161,"description":"A bot network exploited a vulnerability in my GenImNFT contract, extracting over 80 cents.

Visualize stylized digital “bot” entities (glowing geometric shapes or small drone-like agents) racing through a mempool-like network grid toward a smart-contract block labeled “GenImNFT”. One bot steals a tiny coin reward (symbolizing 80 cents), while alarms or red warning indicators flash around the contract. The scene should look technical, cyber-forensic, and slightly humorous due to the small value stolen. Use a dark, neon, cyberpunk color palette of blues, teals, and pinks. Include subtle blockchain motifs (Ethereum logo fragments, gas-fee graphs, bridging arrows). No text overlays.\""}},"nextBlog":null}}
