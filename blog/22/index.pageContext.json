Visualize stylized digital “bot” entities (glowing geometric shapes or small drone-like agents) racing through a mempool-like network grid toward a smart-contract block labeled “GenImNFT”. One bot steals a tiny coin reward (symbolizing 80 cents), while alarms or red warning indicators flash around the contract. The scene should look technical, cyber-forensic, and slightly humorous due to the small value stolen. Use a dark, neon, cyberpunk color palette of blues, teals, and pinks. Include subtle blockchain motifs (Ethereum logo fragments, gas-fee graphs, bridging arrows). No text overlays.\""}},"nextBlog":null}}
