title: Can I have interactive python ?
---

One of my main motivations to start this website was to consolidate different lectures, writings etc that I have accumulated over the years. The first project was to actually move my AMO lectures. This is now finished and can be found over [here](https://www.fretchen.eu/amo). I started with this as it was a really simple test case without anything interactive. However, I have a few more projects which are really based on [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks. They are such fantastic tool to combine notes with simple visualizations and the [jupyter book](https://jupyterbook.org) project is really a great way to publish them. The only "annoying" drawback has been for years that you have to somehow download the notebook and run it locally or go into some service like [binder](https://mybinder.org/). The rise of python in the browser actually promises to changes that at some point. What does this mean ? Projects like [jupyterlite](https://github.com/jupyterlite) allow you to run the full jupyter experience without any installation. And tools like [pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/) bring python directly into the brower. Just python programming without the cloud, with installation just in the browser. This would make the jupyter notebooks that I loved so much extremely portable. And actually, there are now package that attempt to connect this directly to [react](https://github.com/elilambnz/react-py).
