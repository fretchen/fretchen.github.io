Over the last few weeks I kept investigating different ways to my website and to publish content. For the moment I am really happy with the tradtional web2 setup where we I host the static website and voila. However, I recently stumbled across [mirror.xyz](https://mirror.xyz/) and I am intruiged. It feels very much like other publishing platforms like [medium](https://medium.com/). You write a post (like this one) and publish it. With the right ens name and metamask wallet the whole login experience is really smooth. Now the neat thing comes in with the financials. It does not really cost you anything to publish your post which is already a nice break from the usual web3 world where even breathing costs you money. But the neat thing is that people can support you as a creator by mint and liking your post. All of this is deeply integrated into the euthereum eco system and the low fees are enabled by the [optimism chain](https://www.optimism.io/).

 This all inspires new approaches to publishing in a very decentralized way. You publish, people can verify how you are and payment is also included. This takes a lot of the creepiness of advertisement based platforms away. So I think that I will start to cross post these posts to mirror and see how it goes.
