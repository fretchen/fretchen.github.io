Three characters sit apart but connected by scattered documents: Amara with Mediterranean water-basin charts, Sofia with EU briefing notes, and Adam with a glowing laptop showing AI regulations. Soft overhead ferry lights, empty seats, coffee machine humming in the background. Behind them, faint symbolic overlays: a confederation map dissolving into fragments, a federal structure with connected nodes, and a network-like web representing cosmopolitan democracy. Moody, reflective, cinematic atmosphere.\""}},"prevBlog":{"title":"Making My Site Discoverable - SEO, Webmentions, and a Traffic Spike","content":"","type":"react","publishing_date":"2025-10-24","order":"!undefined","tokenID":131,"description":"I overhauled my site's SEO with Schema.org markup and replaced Giscus comments with Webmentions.

Visualize stylized digital “bot” entities (glowing geometric shapes or small drone-like agents) racing through a mempool-like network grid toward a smart-contract block labeled “GenImNFT”. One bot steals a tiny coin reward (symbolizing 80 cents), while alarms or red warning indicators flash around the contract. The scene should look technical, cyber-forensic, and slightly humorous due to the small value stolen. Use a dark, neon, cyberpunk color palette of blues, teals, and pinks. Include subtle blockchain motifs (Ethereum logo fragments, gas-fee graphs, bridging arrows). No text overlays.\""}}}}
