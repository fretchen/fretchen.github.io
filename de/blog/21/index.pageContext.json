Visualize stylized digital “bot” entities (glowing geometric shapes or small drone-like agents) racing through a mempool-like network grid toward a smart-contract block labeled “GenImNFT”. One bot steals a tiny coin reward (symbolizing 80 cents), while alarms or red warning indicators flash around the contract. The scene should look technical, cyber-forensic, and slightly humorous due to the small value stolen. Use a dark, neon, cyberpunk color palette of blues, teals, and pinks. Include subtle blockchain motifs (Ethereum logo fragments, gas-fee graphs, bridging arrows). No text overlays.\""}},"prevBlog":{"title":"Democracy beyond the nation-state - What is there ?","content":"","type":"react","publishing_date":"2025-11-08","order":"!undefined","tokenID":160,"description":"When climate, water, and digital challenges cross borders but democracy doesn't, what's the alternative?

Three characters sit apart but connected by scattered documents: Amara with Mediterranean water-basin charts, Sofia with EU briefing notes, and Adam with a glowing laptop showing AI regulations. Soft overhead ferry lights, empty seats, coffee machine humming in the background. Behind them, faint symbolic overlays: a confederation map dissolving into fragments, a federal structure with connected nodes, and a network-like web representing cosmopolitan democracy. Moody, reflective, cinematic atmosphere.\""}},"nextBlog":{"title":"x402 Implementation Plan für ImageGen","content":"","type":"react","publishing_date":"2025-12-21","order":"!undefined","tokenID":"!undefined","description":"Detaillierter Implementierungsplan zur Integration des x402 Payment-Protokolls in den AI Image Generation Service mit Beibehaltung der NFT-Funktionalität.
