One robot (the “buyer”) sends an HTTP request bubble labeled “POST /genimg”, receives a playful “402 Payment Required” sign, then hands over a glowing crypto coin labeled “USDC”. A third character, a smiling facilitator robot, verifies the payment and passes it along to a stylized blockchain cloud labeled “Optimism L2”. In the final panel, an image and NFT certificate pop out with sparkles. Soft pastel colors, clean line art, minimalistic tech icons, flat design, bright and optimistic mood, modern web3 aesthetic, no dark tones.\""}},"prevBlog":{"title":"How bots exploited my ImageGen contract - and how I fixed it","content":"","type":"react","publishing_date":"2025-12-02","order":"!undefined","tokenID":161,"description":"A bot network exploited a vulnerability in my GenImNFT contract, extracting over 80 cents.

Visualize stylized digital “bot” entities (glowing geometric shapes or small drone-like agents) racing through a mempool-like network grid toward a smart-contract block labeled “GenImNFT”. One bot steals a tiny coin reward (symbolizing 80 cents), while alarms or red warning indicators flash around the contract. The scene should look technical, cyber-forensic, and slightly humorous due to the small value stolen. Use a dark, neon, cyberpunk color palette of blues, teals, and pinks. Include subtle blockchain motifs (Ethereum logo fragments, gas-fee graphs, bridging arrows). No text overlays.\""}},"nextBlog":{"title":"When political compromise becomes irrational","content":"","type":"react","publishing_date":"2026-01-18","order":"!undefined","tokenID":177,"description":"A simple model explains why budget negotiations might fail in democracies","componentPath":"../blog/budget_gridlock_interactive.tsx","category":"others","secondaryCategory":"!undefined","nftMetadata":{"imageUrl":"https://my-imagestore.s3.nl-ams.scw.cloud/images/image_1768747773549_aab4a17f5013.jpg","prompt":"\"A friendly comic-style illustration about political negotiation and game theory","name":"AI Generated Art #1768747773549","description":"AI generated artwork based on the prompt: \"A friendly comic-style illustration about political negotiation and game theory.\nTwo cartoon characters sit at a negotiation table:\n– On the left, a calm owl-like politician (symbolizing long-term thinking), wearing glasses, neatly organized papers.\n– On the right, an energetic hummingbird-like politician (symbolizing short-term pressure), checking a smartphone, slightly messy notes.\nBetween them is a simple control panel with two large sliders, clearly labeled:\n– “Patience” (short-term ↔ long-term)\n– “Political Security” (fragile ↔ secure)\nAbove the sliders, a small display switches between two icons:\n– 🤝 “Cooperate”\n– 👊 “Winner-Takes-All”\nA third character, a thoughtful mediator (human, neutral appearance), stands slightly behind them holding a clipboard, observing rather than intervening.\nStyle: light, friendly, modern comic illustration; soft pastel colors; rounded shapes; clean outlines; optimistic and educational tone.\nBackground: simple and uncluttered, light blue or off-white.\nMood: approachable, explanatory, not dark or cynical.\nNo realism, no photo style, no dramatic lighting.\""}}}}
