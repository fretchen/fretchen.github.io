    "content": "\nIn this first lecture we will review the foundations of quantum\nmechanics at the level of a cooking recipe. This will enable us to use\nthem later for the discussion of the atomic structure and interaction\nbetween atoms and light.\n\nThis is the first lecture of the Advanced Atomic Physics course at\nHeidelberg University, as tought in the wintersemester 2019/2020. It is\nintended for master students, which have a basic understanding of\nquantum mechanics and electromagnetism. In total, we will study multiple\ntopics of modern atomic, molecular and optical physics over a total of\n24 lectures, where each lectures is approximately 90 minutes.\n\n- We will start the series with some basics on quantum mechanics.\n\n- Then work our way into the harmonic oscillator and the hydrogen\n  atom.\n\n- We will then leave the path of increasingly complex atoms for a\n  moment to have some fun with light-propagation, lasers and\n  discussion of the Bell inequalities.\n\n- A discussion of more complex atoms gives us the acutual tools at\n  hand that are in the lab.\n\n- This sets up a discussion of di-atomic molecules, which ends the\n  old-school AMO.\n\n- We move on to quantized atom-light interaction, the Jaynes Cummings\n  model and strong-field lasers.\n\n- We will finally finish with modern ways to implement quantum\n  simulators and quantum computers.\n\nThe topics of the lectures will be discussed in more details in the\nassociated tutorials.\n\n# Introduction\n\nIn AMO physics we will encounter the consequences of quantum mechanics\nall the time. So we will start out with a review of the basic\ningredients to facilitate the later discussion of the experiments.\n\nSome good introductions on the traditional approach can be found in\n[^2002], [^2006], [^CT1], [^CT2]. Previously, we mostly followed the discussion\nof Ref. [^2006]. Nowadays, I also recommend the works by Scott Aaronson in [this](https://scottaaronson.com/democritus/lec9.html) and [this lecture](https://www.scottaaronson.com/barbados-2016.pdf). There is also a good [article by\nQuanta-Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/quantum-theory-rebuilt-from-simple-physical-principles-20170830/#)\non the whole effort to derive quantum mechanics from some simple\nprinciples. This effort started with [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0101012v4), which actually\nmakes for a nice read.\n\nBefore we start with the detailled cooking recipe let us give you some\nexamples of quantum systems, which are of major importance throughout\nthe lecture:\n\n1.  _Orbit in an atom, molecule etc_. Most of you might have studied\n    this during the introduction into quantum mechanics.\n\n2.  _Occupation number of a photon mode_. Any person working on quantum\n    optics has to understand the quantum properties of photons.\n\n3.  _Position of an atom_ is of great importance for double slit\n    experiments, the quantum simulation of condensed matter systems with\n    atoms, or matterwave experiments.\n\n4.  The _spin degree of freedom_ of an atom like in the historical\n    Stern-Gerlach experiment.\n\n5.  The classical coin-toss or bit, which connects us nicely to simple\n    classical probability theory or computing\n\n# The possible outcomes (the Hilbert Space) for the Problem in Question\n\nThe first step is to identify the right Hilbert space for your problem.\nFor a classical problem, we would simply list all the different possible\noutcomes in a list $$(p_1, \\cdots, p_N)$$ of _real_ numbers. As one of the\noutcomes has to happen, we obtain the normalization condition:\n\n```math\n \\sum_i p_i = 1\n```\n\nIn quantum mechanics, we follow a similar approach of first identifying\nthe possible outcomes. But instead of describing the outcomes with real\nnumbers, we now associate a complex number $$\\alpha_i$$ to each outcome\n$$(\\alpha_1, \\cdots, \\alpha_N)$$, with $$\\alpha_i \\in \\mathbb{C}$$. Given\nthat they should also describe some probability they have to be\nnormalized to one, but now we have the condition:\n\n$$\n\\sum_i |\\alpha_i|^2 = 1\n$$\n\nAaronson claims that this is just measuring probabilities in in $L_2$\nnorm. I would highly recommend his discussions on his blog for a more\ninstructive derivation[@quantum]. Next we will not use the traditional\nlists, but the bra-ket notation, by writing:\n\n$$\n\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle = \\sum_i \\alpha_i \\left|i\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nAnd given that these are complex vectors, we will measure their overlap\nthrough a Hermitian scalar product\n\n$$\n\\langle\\psi_1 \\psi_2\\rangle=(\\langle{\\psi_2}| \\psi_1\\rangle)^*.\n$$\n\n## The coin toss\n\nThe situation becomes particularly nice to follow for the two level\nsystem or the coin toss. In classical systems, we will get heads up\n$\\uparrow$ with a certain probability p. So the inverse $\\downarrow$\narrives with likelyhood $1-p$. We would then classical list the\nprobabilities with $(p,1-p)$. In the quantum world we achieve such a\ncoin for example in spin 1/2 systems or qubits in general. We will then\ndescribe the system through the state:\n\n$$\n\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle = \\alpha_\\uparrow \\left|\\uparrow\\right\\rangle + \\alpha_\\downarrow \\left|\\downarrow\\right\\rangle  \\qquad \\text{with} \\; \\langle\\psi | \\psi\\rangle = 1.\n$$\n\nThe next problem is how to act on the system in the classical world or\nin the quantum world.\n\n## Quantum rules\n\nHaving set up the space on which we want to act we have to follow the\nrules of quantum mechanics. The informal way of describing is actually\nnicely described by Chris Monroe [in this\nvideo](https://youtu.be/CC7nlBM2cSM). We might summarize them as\nfollows:\n\n1.  Quantum objects can be in several states at the same time.\n\n2.  Rule number one only works when you are not looking.\n\nThe more methematical fashion is two say that there two ways of\nmanipulating quantum states:\n\n1.  Unitary transformations $\\hat{U}$.\n\n2.  Measurements.\n\n# Unitary transformations\n\nAs states change and evolve, we know that the total probability should\nbe conserved. So we transform the state by some operator $\\hat{U}$,\nwhich just maps the state\n$\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle\\xrightarrow[]{U}\\left|\\psi'\\right\\rangle$.\nThis should not change the norm, and we obtain the condition:\n\n$$\n\\left\\langle\\psi\\right|\\hat{U}^\\dag\\hat{U} \\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle = 1\\\\\n\\hat{U}^\\dag\\hat{U}  = \\mathbb{1}\n$$\n\nThat's the very definition of unitary operators and\nunitary matrices. Going back to the case of a coin toss, we see that we\ncan then transform our qubit through the unitary operator:\n\n$$\n\\hat{U}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n1 & -1\\\\\n1 & 1\n\\end{array}\\right)\n$$\n\nApplying it on the previously defined states $\\uparrow$\nand $\\downarrow$, we get the superposition state:\n\n$$\n\\hat{U}\\left|\\uparrow\\right\\rangle = \\frac{\\left|\\uparrow\\right\\rangle-\\left|\\downarrow\\right\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}\\\\\n\\hat{U}\\left|\\downarrow\\right\\rangle = \\frac{\\left|\\uparrow\\right\\rangle+\\left|\\downarrow\\right\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}\n$$\n\nAs we use the unitary matrices we also see why we might\none to use complex numbers. Imagine that we would like to do something\nthat is roughly the square root of the unitary, which often just means\nthat the system should evolve for half the time as we will see later. If\nwe then have negative nummbers, they will immediately become imaginary.\n\nSuch superposition would not be possible in the classical case, as\nnon-negative values are forbidden there. Actually, operations on\nclassical propability distributions are only possible if every entry of\nthe matrix is non-negative (probabilities are never negative right ?)\nand each column adds up to one (we cannot loose something in a\ntransformation). Such matrices are called .\n\n# Observables and Measurements\n\nAs much fun as it might be to manipulate a quantum state, we also have\nto measure it and how it connects to the properties of the system at\nhand. Any given physical quantity $A$ is associated with a Hermitian\noperator $\\hat{A} = \\hat{A}^\\dag$ acting in the Hilbert space of the\nsystem, which we defined previously. Please, be utterly aware that those\nHermitian operators have absolutely no need to be unitary. However, any\nunitary operator might be written as $\\hat{U}= e^{i\\hat{A}}$.\n\nIn a _measurement_ , the possible outcomes are then the eigenvalues\n$a_\\alpha$ of the operator $\\hat{A}$:\n\n$$\n\\hat{A}\\left|\\alpha\\right\\rangle=a_{\\alpha}\\left|\\alpha\\right\\rangle.\n$$\n\nThe system will collapse to the corresponding\neigenvector and the probability of finding the system in state\n$\\left|\\alpha\\right\\rangle$ is\n\n$$\nP(\\left|\\alpha\\right\\rangle)=||\\hat{P}_{\\left|\\alpha\\right\\rangle} \\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle||^2 = \\left\\langle\\psi\\right| \\hat{P}^{\\dag}_{\\left|\\alpha\\right\\rangle} \\hat{P}_{\\left|\\alpha\\right\\rangle} \\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle,\n$$\n\nwhere\n$\\hat{P}_{\\left|\\alpha\\right\\rangle}= \\left|\\alpha\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle\\alpha\\right|$.\n\nAs for our previous examples, how would you measure them typically, i.e.\nwhat would be the operator ?\n\n1.  In atoms the operators will be angular moment, radius, vibrations\n    etc.\n\n2.  For the occupation number we have nowadays number counting\n    photodectors.\n\n3.  The position of an atom might be detected through high-resolution\n    CCD cameras.\n\n4.  For the _measurement of the spin_, we typically correlate the\n    internal degree of freedom to the spatial degree of freedom. This is\n    done by applying a magnetic field gradient acting on the magnetic\n    moment $\\hat{\\vec{\\mu}}$ , which in turn is associated with the spin\n    via $\\hat{\\vec{\\mu}} = g \\mu_B \\hat{\\vec{s}}/\\hbar$, where $g$ is\n    the Land√© $g$-factor and $\\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton . The energy\n    of the system is $\\hat{H} = -\\hat{\\vec{\\mu}} \\cdot \\vec{B}$.\n\n# Time Evolution\n\nBeing able to access the operator values and intialize the wavefunction\nin some way, we also want to have a prediction on its time-evolution.\nFor most cases of this lecture we can simply describe the system by the\nnon-relativistic **Schr√∂dinger Equation.** It reads\n\n$$\ni\\hbar\\partial_t\\left|\\psi(t)\\right\\rangle=\\hat{H}(t)\\left|\\psi(t)\\right\\rangle.\n$$\n\nIn general, the Hamilton operator $\\hat{H}$ is\ntime-dependent. For a time-independent Hamilton operator $\\hat{H}$, we\ncan find eigenstates $\\left|\\phi_n\\right\\rangle$ with\ncorresponding eigenenergies $E_n$ :\n\n$$\n\\hat{H}\\left|\\phi_n\\right\\rangle=E_n\\left|\\phi_n\\right\\rangle.\n$$\n\nThe eigenstates $\\left|\\phi_n\\right\\rangle$\nin turn have a simple time evolution:\n\n$$\n    \\left|\\phi_n(t)\\right\\rangle=\\left|\\phi_n(0)\\right\\rangle\\cdot \\exp{-i E_nt/\\hbar}.\n$$\n\nIf we know the initial state of a system\n\n$$\n\\left|\\psi(0)\\right\\rangle=\\sum_n \\alpha_n\\left|\\phi_n\\right\\rangle,\n$$\n\nwhere $\\alpha_n=\\langle\\phi_n | \\psi(0)\\rangle$, we will\nknow the full dimension time evolution\n\n$$\n\\left|\\psi(t)\\right\\rangle=\\sum_n\\alpha_n\\left|\\phi_n\\right\\rangle\\exp{-i E_n t/\\hbar}. \\;\\, \\text{(Schr√∂dinger picture)}\n$$\n\n**Note.** Sometimes it is beneficial to work in the\nHeisenberg picture, which works with static ket vectors\n$\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle^{(H)}$ and incorporates the time\nevolution in the operators. [^1] In certain cases one would have to have\naccess to relativistic dynamics, which are then described by the **Dirac\nequation**. However, we will only touch on this topic very briefly, as\nit directly leads us into the intruiging problems of **quantum\nelectrodynamics**.\n\n## The Heisenberg picture\n\nAs mentionned in the first lecture it can benefitial to work in the\nHeisenberg picture instead of the Schr√∂dinger picture. This approach is\nwidely used in the field of many-body physics, as it underlies the\nformalism of the second quantization. To make the connection with the\nSchr√∂dinger picture we should remember that we have the formal solution\nof\n\n$$\n\\left|\\psi(t)\\right\\rangle = \\mathrm{e}^{-i\\hat{H}t}\\left|\\psi(0)\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nSo, if we would like to look into the expectation value\nof some operator, we have:\n\n$$\n\\langle\\hat{A}(t)\\rangle = \\left\\langle\\psi(0)\\right|\\mathrm{e}^{i\\hat{H}t}\\hat{A}_S\\mathrm{e}^{-i\\hat{H}t}\\left|\\psi(0)\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nThis motivates the following definition of the operator\nin the Heisenberg picture:\n\n$$\n    \\hat{A}_H=\\mathrm{e}^{i{\\hat{H} t}/{\\hbar}} \\hat{A}_S \\mathrm{e}^{-i{\\hat{H} t}/{\\hbar}}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\exp{-i{\\hat{H} t}/{\\hbar}}$ is a time evolution\noperator (N.B.: $\\hat{H}_S = \\hat{H}_H$). The time evolution of\n$\\hat{A}_H$ is:\n\n$$\n    \\frac{d}{dt} \\hat{A}_H = \\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\hat{H}\\mathrm{e}^{i{\\hat{H}t}/{\\hbar}}\\hat{A}_S \\mathrm{e}^{-i{\\hat{H} t}/{\\hbar}}\\\\\n    -\\frac{i}{\\hbar} \\mathrm{e}^{i{\\hat{H} t}/{\\hbar}}\\hat{A}_S \\mathrm{e}^{-i{\\hat{H}t}/{\\hbar}}\\hat{H}+\\partial_t \\hat{A}_H\\\\\n    = \\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\left[\\hat{H},\\hat{A}_H\\right] + \\mathrm{e}^{i{\\hat{H}t}/{\\hbar}}\\partial_t\\hat{A}_S\\mathrm{e}^{-i{\\hat{H}t}/{\\hbar}}\n$$\n\n**Note.** In the Heisenberg picture the state vectors\nare time-independent:\n\n$$\n    \\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle_H \\equiv \\left|\\psi(t=0)\\right\\rangle=\\exp{i{\\hat{H}}t/{\\hbar}} \\left|\\psi(t)\\right\\rangle.\n$$\n\nTherefore, the results of measurements are the same in\nboth pictures:\n\n$$\n \\left\\langle\\psi(t)\\right|\\hat{A}\\left|\\psi(t)\\right\\rangle = \\left\\langle\\psi\\right|_H \\hat{A}_H \\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle_H.\n$$\n\n[^1]:\n    We will follow this route in the discussion of the two-level\n    system and the Bloch sphere.\n\n[^2002]: Dalibard Basdevant.

    "title": "Lecture 2 - A few more cooking recipes for quantum mechanics",
    "content": "\nIn this second lecture we will finish the discussion of the basic\ncooking recipes and discuss a few of the consequences like the\nuncertainty relation, the existance of wave packages and the Ehrenfest\ntheorem.\n\nIn the first lecture we discussed briefly the basic\nprinciples of quantum mechanics like operators, state vectors and the\nSchr√∂dinger equation. We will finish this discussion today and then\nintroduce the most important consequences. We will continue to closely\nfollow the discussion of the introductory chapter of Ref. [^2006]\n\n## Composite systems\n\nIt is actually quite rare that we can label the system with a single\nquantum number. Any atom will involve spin, position, angular momentum.\nOther examples might just involve two spin which we observe. So the\nquestion is then on how we label those systems. We then have two\nquestions to answer:\n\n1.  How many labels do we need for a system to fully determine its\n    quantum state ?\n\n2.  Once I know all the labels, how do I construct the full state out of\n    them ?\n\nWe will actually discuss the second question first as it sets the\nnotation for the first question.\n\n### Entangled States\n\nIn AMO we typically would like to characterize is the state of an\nelectron in a hydrogen atom. We need to define its angular momentum\nlabel $L$, which might be 0, 1, 2 and also its electron spin $S$, which\nmight be $\\{\\uparrow, \\downarrow\\}$. It state is then typically labelled\nas something like\n\n$$\\left|L=0, S=\\uparrow\\right\\rangle = \\left|0,\\uparrow\\right\\rangle$$\n\netc.\n\nAnother, simple example is that of two spins, each one having two\npossible states $\\{\\uparrow, \\downarrow\\}$. This is a standard problem\nin optical communication, where you send correlated photons with a\ncertain polarization to different people. We will typically call them\nAlice and Bob [^1].\n\nWe now would like to understand than if we can disentangle the\ninformation about the different labels. Naively, we can now associate\nwith Alice one set of outcomes and describe it by some state\n$\\left|\\psi_{A}\\right\\rangle$ and the Bob has another set\n$\\left|\\psi_{B}\\right\\rangle$:\n\n$$\n\\left|\\psi_A\\right\\rangle= a_{\\uparrow} \\left|\\uparrow_A\\right\\rangle+ a_{\\downarrow} \\left|\\downarrow_A\\right\\rangle\\\\\n\\left|\\psi_B\\right\\rangle= b_{\\uparrow} \\left|\\uparrow_B\\right\\rangle+ b_{\\downarrow} \\left|\\downarrow_B\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nThe full state will then be described by the possible outcomes\n$\\{\\uparrow_A\\uparrow_B,\\downarrow_A\\uparrow_B,\\uparrow_A\\downarrow_B, \\downarrow_A\\downarrow_B\\}$.\nWe can then write:\n\n$$\n\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle = \\alpha_{\\uparrow\\uparrow}(\\left|\\uparrow_A\\right\\rangle\\otimes\\left|\\uparrow_B\\right\\rangle)+\\alpha_{\\uparrow\\downarrow}(\\left|\\uparrow_A\\right\\rangle\\otimes\\left|\\downarrow_B\\right\\rangle)+\\alpha_{\\downarrow\\uparrow}(\\left|\\downarrow_A\\right\\rangle\\otimes\\left|\\uparrow_B\\right\\rangle)+\\alpha_{\\downarrow\\downarrow}(\\left|\\downarrow_A\\right\\rangle\\otimes\\left|\\downarrow_B\\right\\rangle)\\\\\n= \\alpha_{\\uparrow\\uparrow}\\left|\\uparrow\\uparrow\\right\\rangle+\\alpha_{\\uparrow\\downarrow}\\left|\\uparrow\\downarrow\\right\\rangle+\\alpha_{\\downarrow\\uparrow}\\left|\\downarrow \\uparrow\\right\\rangle+\\alpha_{\\downarrow\\downarrow}\\left|\\downarrow\\downarrow\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nSo we will typically just plug the labels into a single\nket and drop indices, to avoid rewriting the tensor symbol each time. We\nsay that a state is _separable_, if we can write it as a product of the\ntwo individual states as above:\n\n$$\n\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle = \\left|\\psi_A\\right\\rangle\\otimes\\left|\\psi_B\\right\\rangle\\\\\n=a_{\\uparrow} b_\\uparrow \\left|\\uparrow\\uparrow\\right\\rangle+a_{\\downarrow} b_\\uparrow \\left|\\downarrow\\uparrow\\right\\rangle+a_{\\uparrow} b_\\downarrow \\left|\\uparrow\\downarrow\\right\\rangle+a_{\\downarrow} b_\\downarrow \\left|\\downarrow\\downarrow\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nAll other states are called _entangled_. The most famous entangled\nstates are the Bell states:\n\n$$\n\\left|\\psi_\\textrm{Bell}\\right\\rangle=\\frac{\\left|\\uparrow\\uparrow\\right\\rangle+\\left|\\downarrow\\downarrow\\right\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}\n$$\n\nIn general we will say that the quantum system is formed by two\nsubsystems $S_1$ and $S_2$. If they are independent we can write each of\nthem as:\n\n$$\n\\left|\\psi_1\\right\\rangle=\\sum_m^M a_m \\left|\\alpha_m\\right\\rangle,\\\\\n\\left|\\psi_2\\right\\rangle=\\sum_n^N b_n \\left|\\beta_n\\right\\rangle.\n$$\n\nIn general we will then write:\n\n$$\n\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle=\\sum_m^M \\sum_n^N c_{mn}(\\left|\\alpha_m\\right\\rangle\\otimes \\left|\\beta_n\\right\\rangle).\n$$\n\nSo we can determine such a state by $M \\times N$ numbers\n$c_{mn}$ here. If the states are _separable_, we can write\n$\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle$ as a product of the individual\nstates:\n\n$$\n\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle=\\left|\\psi_1\\right\\rangle\\otimes\\left|\\psi_2\\right\\rangle=\\left(\\sum_m^M a_m \\left|\\alpha_m\\right\\rangle\\right) \\otimes \\left(\\sum_n^N b_n \\left|\\beta_n\\right\\rangle\\right)\n$$\n\n$$\n\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle=\\sum_m^M \\sum_n^N a_m b_n \\left|\\alpha_m\\right\\rangle \\otimes \\left|\\beta_n\\right\\rangle.\n$$\n\nSeparable states thus only describes a small subset of all possible\nstates.\n\n## Statistical Mixtures and Density Operator\n\nHaving set up the formalism for writing down the full quantum state with\nplenty of labels, we have to solve the next problem. As an\nexperimentalist, you will rarely measure all of them. This means that\nyou only perform a partial measurement and you have only partial\ninformation of the system. The extreme case is the thermodynamic\nensemble, where we measure only temperature to describe $10^{23}$\nparticles.\n\nA similiar problem arises for Alice and Bob. They typically measure the\nstate of the qubit in their lab without knowing what the other did. So\nthey need some way to describe the system locally. This is done through\nthe density operator approach.\n\nIn the density operator approach the state of the system is described by\na Hermitian density operator\n\n$$\n \\hat{\\rho} = \\sum_{n=1}^N p_n \\left|\\phi_n\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle\\phi_n\\right|.\n$$\n\nHere, $\\left\\langle\\phi_n\\right|$ are the\neigenstates of $\\hat{\\rho}$, and $p_n$ are the probabilities to find the\nsystem in the respective states\n$\\left|\\phi_n\\right\\rangle$. The trace of the density\noperator is the sum of all probabilities $p_n$:\n\n$$\n  \\mathrm{tr}(\\hat{\\rho}) = \\sum p_n = 1.\n$$\n\nFor a pure state $\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle$, we get $p_n=1$\nfor only one value of $n$. For every other $n$, the probabilities\nvanish. We thus obtain a \"pure\" density operator\n$\\hat{\\rho}_{\\text{pure}}$ which has the properties of a projection\noperator:\n\n$$\n\\hat{\\rho}_{\\text{pure}} = \\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle\\psi\\right| \\qquad \\Longleftrightarrow \\qquad \\hat{\\rho}^2 = \\hat{\\rho}.\n$$\n\nFor the simple qubit we then have:\n\n$$\n  \\hat{\\rho}= \\left(\\alpha_\\uparrow\\left|\\uparrow\\right\\rangle+\\alpha_\\downarrow\\left|\\downarrow\\right\\rangle\\right)\\left(\\alpha_\\uparrow^*\\left\\langle\\uparrow\\right|+\\alpha_\\downarrow^*\\left\\langle\\downarrow\\right|\\right)\\\\\n  = |\\alpha_\\uparrow|^2\\left|\\uparrow\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle\\uparrow\\right|+|\\alpha_\\downarrow|^2\\left|\\downarrow\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle\\downarrow\\right|+\\alpha_\\downarrow\\alpha_\\uparrow^*\\left|\\downarrow\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle\\uparrow\\right|+\\alpha_\\uparrow\\alpha_\\downarrow^*\\left|\\uparrow\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle\\downarrow\\right|\n$$\n\nThen it is even simpler to write in matrix form:\n\n$$\n  \\hat{\\rho}= \\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n  |\\alpha_\\uparrow|^2&\\alpha_\\uparrow\\alpha_\\downarrow^*\\\\\n  \\alpha_\\downarrow\\alpha_\\uparrow^*&|\\alpha_\\downarrow|^2\n  \\end{array}\\right)\n$$\n\nFor a thermal state on the other hand we have:\n\n$$\n\\hat{\\rho}_{\\text{thermal}} = \\sum_{n=1}^N \\frac{e^{-\\frac{E_n}{k_BT}}}{Z} \\left|\\phi_n\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle\\phi_n\\right|\\text{ with }Z = \\sum_{n=1}^N e^{-\\frac{E_n}{k_BT}}\n$$\n\nWith this knowledge we can now determine the result of a\nmeasurement of an observable $A$ belonging to an operator $\\hat{A}$. For\nthe pure state $\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle$ we get:\n\n$$\n\\langle \\hat{A}\\rangle = \\left\\langle\\psi\\right| \\hat{A} \\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle.\n$$\n\nFor a mixed state we get:\n\n$$\n\\langle \\hat{A}\\rangle = \\mathrm{tr}(\\hat{\\rho}\\cdot \\hat{A}) = \\sum_n {p_n} \\left\\langle\\phi_n\\right| \\hat{A} \\left|\\phi_n\\right\\rangle.\n$$\n\nThe time evolution of the density operator can be\nexpressed with the von Neumann equation:\n\n$$\ni\\hbar \\partial_{t}\\hat{\\rho}(t) = [\\hat{H}(t),\\hat{\\rho}(t)].\n$$\n\n### Back to partial measurements\n\nWe can now come back to the correlated photons sent to Alice and Bob,\nsharing a Bell pair. They full density matrix is then especially simple:\n\n$$\n  \\hat{\\rho}= \\left(\\begin{array}{cccc}\n  \\frac{1}{2}& 0& 0 &\\frac{1}{2}\\\\\n  0 & 0 & 0& 0\\\\\n  0&0&0&0\\\\\n    \\frac{1}{2}&0&0&\\frac{1}{2}\n  \\end{array}\\right)\n$$\n\nLet us write the system as $S = S_A \\otimes S_B$. If we are looking for\nthe density operator $\\hat{\\rho}_i$ of each individual, we can simply\nwrite:\n\n$$\n\\hat{\\rho}_A=\\mathrm{tr}_{B}(\\hat{\\rho}),\\\\\n\\hat{\\rho}_B=\\mathrm{tr}_{A}(\\hat{\\rho}),\n$$\n\nwhere\n$\\hat{\\rho}=\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle\\psi\\right|$\nand $\\mathrm{tr}_{j}(\\hat{\\rho})$ is the trace over the Hilbert space of\nsubsystem $j$.\n\nTo reduce the density matrix of the Bell state it is actually helpful to\nwrite out the definitions:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{tr}_{B}(\\hat{\\rho}) = \\left\\langle\\uparrow_B\\right|\\hat{\\rho}\\left|\\uparrow_B\\right\\rangle+\\left\\langle\\downarrow_B\\right|\\hat{\\rho}\\left|\\downarrow_B\\right\\rangle\\\\\n=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|\\uparrow_A\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle\\uparrow_A\\right|+\\left|\\downarrow_A\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle\\downarrow_A\\right|\\right)\n$$\n\nSo we end up with the fully mixed state:\n\n$$\n  \\hat{\\rho}_{A,B} = \\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n  \\frac{1}{2}&0\\\\\n  0&\\frac{1}{2}\n  \\end{array}\\right)\n$$\n\nAlice and Bob are simply cossing a coin if they ignore\nthe outcome of the other member. But once they start comparing results\nwe will see that the quantum case can dramatically differ from the\nclassical case.

Thus, the measurement of all\nquantities $\\{A,B,\\cdots,X\\}$ will determine the system uniquely. The\nclean identification of such a Hilbert space can be quite challenging\nand a nice way of its measurment even more. Coming back to our previous\nexamples:\n\n1.  Performing the full spectroscopy of the atom. Even for the hydrogen\n    atom we will see that the full answer can be rather involved\\...\n\n2.  The occupation number is rather straight forward. However, we have\n    to be careful that we really collect a substantial amount of the\n    photons etc.\n\n3.  Are we able to measure the full position information ?

What are the components of the spin that we can access ? The $z$\n    component does not commute with the other components, so what should\n    we measure ?\n\nIn the [third\nlecture](https://www.authorea.com/326444/GsbfEypTdf4dvncV23L8_Q) of this\ncourse will start to apply these discussions to the two-level system,\nwhich is one of the simplest yet most powerful models of quantum\nmechanics.\n\n[^1]: And if someone wants to listen the person is called Eve\n\n[^2006]: Jean Dalibard Jean-Louis Basdevant.

    "title": "Lecture 3 - The two-level system",
    "content": "\nWe are going to discuss the two-level system, it's static properties\nlike level splitting at avoided crossings and dynamical properties like\nRabi oscillations.\n\nAfter the previous discussions of some basic cooking recipes to quantum\nmechanics in last weeks lectures, we will use them to understand the two-level system. A very detailled\ndiscussion can be found in chapter 4 of Ref. [^CT1]. The importance of the\ntwo-level system is at least three-fold:\n\n1.  It is the simplest system of quantum mechanics as it spans a Hilbert\n    space of only two states.\n\n2.  It is quite ubiquitous in nature and very widely used in atomic\n    physics.\n\n3.  The two-level system is another word for the qubit, which is the\n    fundamental building block of the exploding field of quantum\n    computing and quantum information science.\n\n<img src=\"./lecture3_pic1.png\" width=\"90%\">\n\nExamples for two-state systems. a) Benzene: In the ground state, the\nelectrons are delocalized. b) Ammonia: The nitrogen atom is either found\nabove or below the hydrogen triangle. The state changes when the\nnitrogen atom tunnels. c) Molecular ion : The electron is either\nlocalized near proton 1 or 2.\n\nSome of the many examples for two-level systems that can be found in\nnature:\n\n- Spin of the electron: Up vs. down state\n\n- Two-level atom with one electron (simplified): Excited vs. ground\n  state\n\n- Structures of molecules, e.g., $NH_3$\n\n- Occupation of mesoscopic capacitors in nanodevices.\n\n- Current states in superconducting loops.\n\n- Nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond.\n\n## Hamiltonian, Eigenstates and Matrix Notation\n\nTo start out, we will consider two eigenstates\n$\\left|0\\right\\rangle$, $\\left|1\\right\\rangle$\nof the Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}_0$ with\n\n$$\n \\hat{H}_0\\left|0\\right\\rangle=E_0\\left|0\\right\\rangle, \\qquad \\hat{H}_0\\left|1\\right\\rangle=E_1\\left|1\\right\\rangle.\n$$\n\nQuite typically we might think of it as a two-level atom\nwith states 1 and 2. The eigenstates can be expressed in matrix\nnotation:\n\n$$\n \\left|0\\right\\rangle=\\left( \\begin{array}{c} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{array} \\right), \\qquad \\left|1\\right\\rangle=\\left( \\begin{array}{c} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{array} \\right),\n$$\n\nso that $\\hat{H}_0$ be written as a diagonal matrix\n\n$$\n    \\hat{H}_0 = \\left(\\begin{array}{cc} E_0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & E_1 \\end{array}\\right).\n$$\n\nIf we would only prepare eigenstates the system would be\nrather boring. However, we typically have the ability to change the\nHamiltonian by switching on and off laser or microwave fields [^1]. We\ncan then write the Hamiltonian in its most general form as:\n\n$$\n\n\\hat{H} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} \\Delta  & \\Omega_x - i\\Omega_y\\\\ \\Omega_x +i\\Omega_y & -\\Delta \\end{array} \\right)\n$$\n\nSometimes we will also chose the definition:\n\n$$\n\\Omega = |\\Omega| e^{i\\varphi}=\\Omega_x + i\\Omega_y\n$$\n\nIt is particularly useful for the case in which the\ncoupling is created by a laser. Another useful way of thinking about the\ntwo-level system is as a spin in a magnetic field. Let us remind us of\nthe definitions of the of the spin-1/2 matrices:\n\n$$\ns_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n0 & 1\\\\\n1 &  0\n\\end{array}\n\\right)~\ns_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n0 & -i\\\\\ni &  0\n\\end{array}\n\\right)~s_z =\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n1 & 0\\\\\n0 &  -1\n\\end{array}\n\\right)\n$$\n\nWe then obtain:\n\n$$\n\n\\hat{H} = \\mathbf{B}\\cdot\\hat{\\mathbf{s}}\\text{ with }\\mathbf{B} = (\\Omega_x, \\Omega_y, \\Delta)\n$$\n\nYou will go through this calculation in the excercise of\nthis week.\n\n### Case of no perturbation $\\Omega = 0$\n\nThis is exactly the case of no applied laser fields that we discussed\npreviously. We simply removed the energy offset\n$E_m = \\frac{E_0+E_1}{2}$ and pulled out the factor $\\hbar$, such that\n$\\Delta$ measures a frequency. So we have:\n\n$$\nE_0 = E_m+ \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\Delta\\\\\nE_1 = E_m- \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\Delta\n$$\n\nWe typically call $\\Delta$ the energy difference between\nthe levels or the **detuning**.\n\n### Case of no detuning $\\Delta = 0$\n\nLet us suppose that the diagonal elements are exactly zero. And for\nsimplicity we will also keep $\\Omega_y =0$ as it simply complicates the\ncalculations without adding much to the discussion at this stage. The\nHamiltonian reads then:\n\n$$\n\\hat{H} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 0  & \\Omega\\\\ \\Omega &0 \\end{array} \\right)\n$$\n\nQuite clearly the states $\\varphi_{1,2}$ are not the eigenstates of the\nsystem anymore. How should the system be described now ? We can once\nagain diagonalize the system and write\n\n$$\n\\hat{H}\\left|\\varphi_{\\pm}\\right\\rangle = E_{\\pm}\\left|\\varphi_\\pm\\right\\rangle\\\\\nE_{\\pm} = \\pm\\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\Omega\\\\\n\\left|\\varphi_\\pm\\right\\rangle = \\frac{\\left|0\\right\\rangle\\pm\\left|1\\right\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}\n$$\n\nTwo important consequences can be understood from this\nresult:\n\n1.  The coupling of the two states shifts their energy by $\\Omega$. This\n    is the idea of level repulsion.\n\n2.  The coupled states are a superposition of the initial states.\n\nThis is also a motivation the formulation of the 'bare' system for\n$\\Omega = 0$ and the 'dressed' states for the coupled system.\n\n### General case\n\nQuite importantly we can solve the system completely even in the general\ncase. By diagonalizing the Hamiltonian we obtain:\n\n$$\n E_\\pm = \\pm \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sqrt{\\Delta^2+|\\Omega|^2}\n$$\n\nThe energies can be nicely summarized as in Fig.\n\n<img src=\"./lecture3_pic2.png\" width=\"90%\">\n\nThe Eigenstates then read:\n\n$$\n\\left|\\psi_+\\right\\rangle=\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\mathrm{e}^{-i{\\varphi}/{2}}\\left|0\\right\\rangle+\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\mathrm{e}^{i{\\varphi}/{2}}\\left|1\\right\\rangle,\n$$\n\n$$\n\\left|\\psi_-\\right\\rangle=-\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\mathrm{e}^{-i{\\varphi}/{2}}\\left|0\\right\\rangle+\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\mathrm{e}^{i{\\varphi}/{2}}\\left|1\\right\\rangle,\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\n\\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{|\\Omega|}{\\Delta}\n$$\n\n## The Bloch sphere\n\nWhile we could just discuss the details of the above state in the\nabstract, it is extremely helpful to visualize the problem on the Bloch\nsphere. The idea of the Bloch sphere is that the we have a complex wave\nfunction of well defined norm and two free parameters. So it seems quite\nnatural to look for a good representation of it. And this is the Bloch\nsphere as drawn below\n\n<img src=\"./lecture3_pic3.png\" width=\"90%\">\n\nWe will see especially its usefulness especially as we discuss the\ndynamics of the two-state system.\n\n## Dynamical Aspects\n\n### Time Evolution of $\\left|\\psi(t)\\right\\rangle$\n\nAfter the static case we now want to investigate the dynamical\nproperties of the two-state system. We calculate the time evolution of\n$\\left|\\psi(t)\\right\\rangle = c_0(t)\\left|0\\right\\rangle + c_1(t)\\left|1\\right\\rangle$\nwith the Schr√∂dinger equation and the perturbed Hamiltonian:\n\n$$\ni\\hbar \\frac{d}{dt}\\left|\\psi(t)\\right\\rangle=\\hat{H}\\left|\\psi(t)\\right\\rangle,\\\\\ni \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\begin{array}{c} c_0(t) \\\\ c_1(t) \\end{array}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} \\Delta & \\Omega \\\\ \\Omega^* & -\\Delta \\end{array} \\right) \\left(\\begin{array}{c} c_0(t) \\\\ c_1(t) \\end{array} \\right).\n$$\n\nWe have two coupled differential equations and we luckily already know\nhow to solve them as we have calculated the two eigenenergies in the\nprevious section. For the state\n$\\left|\\psi(t)\\right\\rangle$ we get\n\n$$\n \\left|\\psi(t)\\right\\rangle=\\lambda \\mathrm{e}^{-i{E_+}t/{\\hbar}} \\left|\\psi_+\\right\\rangle + \\mu \\mathrm{e}^{-i{E_-}t/{\\hbar}} \\left|\\psi_-\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nwith the factors $\\lambda$ and $\\mu$, which are defined\nby the initial state. The most common question is then what happens to\nthe system if we start out in the bare state\n$\\left|0\\right\\rangle$ and then let it evolve under\ncoupling with a laser ? So what is the probability to find it in the\nother state $\\left|1\\right\\rangle$:\n\n$$\nP_1(t)=\\left|\\left\\langle 1|\\psi(t)\\right\\rangle\\right|^2.\n$$\n\nAs a first step, we have to apply the initial condition\nto and express\n$\\left|\\varphi\\right\\rangle$ in terms of $|\\psi_+$ and $|\\psi_-$:\n\n$$\n\\left|\\psi(0)\\right\\rangle \\overset{!}{=} \\left|0\\right\\rangle\\\\\n  = \\mathrm{e}^{i{\\varphi}/{2}} \\left[ \\cos\\left( \\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\left|\\psi_+\\right\\rangle-\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)\\left|\\psi_-\\right\\rangle\\right]\n$$\n\nBy equating the coefficients we get for $\\lambda$ and\n$\\mu$:\n\n$$\n\\lambda = \\mathrm{e}^{i{\\varphi}/{2}}\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right), \\qquad  \\mu = -\\mathrm{e}^{i{\\varphi}/{2}}\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right).\n$$\n\nOne thus gets:\n\n$$\n\\hspace{-2mm} P_1(t)=\\left|\\left\\langle 1|\\psi(t)\\right\\rangle\\right|^2 \\\\\n= \\left|\\mathrm{e}^{i\\varphi} \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)\\left[\\mathrm{e}^{-i{E_+}t/{\\hbar}} - \\mathrm{e}^{-i{E_-}t/{\\hbar}}\\right]\\right|^2\\\\\n= \\sin^2(\\theta)\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{E_+-E_-}{2\\hbar}t\\right)\n$$\n\n$P_1(t)$ can be expressed with $\\Delta$ and $\\Omega$\nalone. The obtained relation is called Rabi's formula:\n\n$$\n P_1(t)=\\frac{1}{1+\\left(\\frac{\\Delta}{|\\Omega|}\\right)^2}\\sin^2\\left(\\sqrt{|\\Omega|^2+\\Delta^2}\\frac{t}{2}\\right)\n$$\n\n<img src=\"./lecture3_pic4.png\" width=\"90%\">\n\n### Visualization of the dynamics in the spin picture\n\nWhile the previous derivation might be the standard one, which certainly\nleads to the right results it might not be the most intuitive way of\nthinking about the dynamics. They become actually quite transparent in\nthe spin language and on the Bloch sphere. So let us go back to the\nformulation of the Hamiltonian in terms of spins as at the beginning of the lecture.\n\nHow would the question of the time evolution from $0$ to $1$ and back go\nnow ? Basically, we would assume that the spin has been initialize into\none of the eigenstates of the $z$-basis and now starts to rotate in some\nmagnetic field. How ? This can be nicely studied in the Heisenberg\npicture, where operators have a time evolution. In the Heisenberg\npicture we have:\n\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\hat{s}_i = \\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\left[\\hat{H},\\hat{s}_i\\right]\\\\\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\hat{s}_i = \\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\sum_j B_j \\left[\\hat{s}_j,\\hat{s}_i\\right]\\\\\n\n\n$$\n\nSo to understand we time evolution, we only need to\nemploy the commutator relationships between the spins:\n\n$$\n= \\hbar is_z~~[ s_y, s_z] = \\hbar is_x~~[ s_z, s_x] = \\hbar is_y\n$$\n\nFor the specific case of $B_x=\\Omega$, $B_y = B_z = 0$,\nwe have then:\n\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\hat{s}_x = 0\\\\\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\hat{s}_y = -\\Omega \\hat{s}_z\\\\\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\hat{s}_z = \\Omega \\hat{s}_y\n\n\n$$\n\nSo applying a field in x-direction leads to a rotation of the spin\naround the $x$ axis with velocity $\\Omega$. We can now use this general\npicture to understand the dynamics as rotations around an axis, which is\ndefined by the different components of the magnetic field.\n\n## A few words on the quantum information notation\n\nThe qubit is THE basic ingredient of quantum computers. A nice way to\nplay around with them is actually the [IBM Quantum\nexperience](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/). However, you will\ntypically not find Pauli matrices etc within these systems. The typical\nnotation there is:\n\n- $R_x(\\phi)$ is a rotation around the x-axis for an angle $\\phi$.\n\n- Same holds for $R_y$ and $R_z$.\n\n- $X$ denotes the rotation around the x axis for an angle $\\pi$. So it\n  transforms $\\left|1\\right\\rangle$ into\n  $\\left|0\\right\\rangle$ and vise versa.\n\n- $Z$ denotes the rotation around the x axis for an angle $\\pi$. So it\n  transforms $\\left|+\\right\\rangle$ into\n  $\\left|-\\right\\rangle$ and vise versa.\n\nThe most commonly used gate is actually one that we did not talk about\nat all, it is the _Hadamard_ gate, which transforms\n$\\left|1\\right\\rangle$ into\n$\\left|-\\right\\rangle$ and\n$\\left|0\\right\\rangle$ into\n$\\left|+\\right\\rangle$:\n\n$$\n\\hat{H}\\left|1\\right\\rangle = \\left|-\\right\\rangle  ~   \\hat{H}\\left|0\\right\\rangle = \\left|+\\right\\rangle\\\\\n\\hat{H}\\left|-\\right\\rangle = \\left|1\\right\\rangle  ~   \\hat{H}\\left|+\\right\\rangle = \\left|0\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nIn the forth lecture we will see how it is that a time-dependent field can actually couple two atomic states, which are normally of very different energies.\n\n[^1]: See the discussions of the next lecture\n\n[^CT1]: Quantum Mechanics, Volume 1.

    "title": "Lecture 4 - Atoms in oscillating fields",
    "content": "\nIn the lecture, we will see how a time dependent coupling allows us to\nengineer a new Hamiltonian. Most importantly, we will discuss the\nresonant coupling of two levels and the decay of a single level to a\ncontinuum.\n\nIn the last lecture, we discussed the properties of two\ncoupled levels. However, we did not elaborate at any stage how such a\nsystem might emerge in a true atom. Two fundamental questions come to\nmind:\n\n1.  How is it that a laser allows to treat two atomic levels of very\n    different energies as if they were degenerate ?\n\n2.  An atom has many energy levels $E_n$ and most of them are not\n    degenerate. How can we reduce this complicated structure to a\n    two-level system?\n\nThe solution is to resonantly couple two of the atom's levels by\napplying an external, oscillatory field, which is very nicely discussed\nin chapter 12 of Ref. [^2002] [^Cohen_Tannoudji_1998]. We will discuss\nimportant and fundamental properties of systems with a time-dependent\nHamiltonian.\n\nWe will discuss a simple model for the atom in the oscillatory field. We\ncan write down the Hamiltonian:\n\n$$\n \\hat{H} = \\hat{H}_0 + \\hat{V}(t).\n$$\n\nHere, $\\hat{H}_0$ belongs to the atom and $V(t)$\ndescribes the time-dependent field and its interaction with the atom. We\nassume that $\\left|n\\right\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of\n$\\hat{H}_0$ and write:\n\n$$\n\\hat{H}_0\\left|n\\right\\rangle = E_n \\left|n\\right\\rangle.\n$$\n\nIf the system is initially prepared in the state\n$\\left|i\\right\\rangle$, so that\n\n$$\n\\left|\\psi(t=0)\\right\\rangle = \\left|i\\right\\rangle,\n$$\n\nwhat is the probability\n\n$$\nP_m(t) = \\left|\\left\\langle m|\\psi(t)\\right\\rangle\\right|^2\n$$\n\nto find the system in the state\n$\\left|m\\right\\rangle$ at the time $t$?\n\n## Evolution Equation\n\nThe system $\\left|\\psi(t)\\right\\rangle$ can be expressed as\nfollows:\n\n$$\n\\left|\\psi(t)\\right\\rangle = \\sum_n \\gamma_n(t) \\mathrm{e}^{-i{E_n}t/{\\hbar}} \\left|n\\right\\rangle,\n$$\n\nwhere the exponential is the time evolution for\n$\\hat{H}_1 =~0$. We plug this equation in the Schr√∂dinger equation and\nget:\n\n$$\ni\\hbar \\sum_n\\left(\\dot{\\gamma}_n(t)-i\\frac{E_n}{\\hbar}\\gamma_n(t)\\right)\\mathrm{e}^{-i{E_n}t/{\\hbar}}\\left|n\\right\\rangle = \\sum_n \\gamma_n(t) \\mathrm{e}^{-i{E_n}t/{\\hbar}}\\left(\\hat{H}_0 + \\hat{V}\\right) \\left|n\\right\\rangle\\\\\n\\Longleftrightarrow i\\hbar\\sum_n \\dot{\\gamma}_n(t) \\mathrm{e}^{-i{E_n}t/{\\hbar}} \\left|n\\right\\rangle\n = \\sum_n \\gamma_n(t) \\mathrm{e}^{-i{E_n}t/{\\hbar}} \\hat{V} \\left|n\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nIf we multiply the equation with $\\left\\langle k\\right|$ we\nobtain a set of coupled differential equations\n\n$$\ni\\hbar \\dot{\\gamma}_k \\mathrm{e}^{-i{E_k}t/{\\hbar}} = \\sum_n \\gamma_n \\mathrm{e}^{-{E_n}t/{\\hbar}}\\left\\langle k\\right|\\hat{V}\\left|n\\right\\rangle,\\\\\ni\\hbar \\dot{\\gamma}_k = \\sum_n \\gamma_n \\mathrm{e}^{-i {(E_n-E_k)}t/{\\hbar}} \\left\\langle k\\right| \\hat{V}\\left|n\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nwith initial conditions\n$\\left|\\psi(t=0)\\right\\rangle$. They determine the full\ntime evolution.\n\nThe solution of this set of equations depends on the details of the\nsystem. However, there are a few important points:\n\n- For short enough times, the dynamics are driving by the coupling\n  strength\n  $\\left\\langle k\\right|\\hat{V} \\left|n\\right\\rangle$.\n\n- The right-hand sight will oscillate on time scales of $E_n-E_k$ and\n  typically average to zero for long times.\n\n- If the coupling element is an oscillating field\n  $\\propto e^{i\\omega_L t}$, it might put certain times on resonance\n  and allow us to avoid the averaging effect. It is exactly this\n  effect, which allows us to isolate specific transitions to a very\n  high degree [^1]\n\nWe will now see how the two-state system emerges from these\napproximations and then set-up the perturbative treatment step-by-step.\n\n## Rotating wave approximation\n\nWe will now assume that the coupling term in indeed an oscillating field\nwith frequency $\\omega_L$, so it reads:\n\n$$\n\\hat{V} = \\hat{V}_0 \\cos(\\omega_Lt) = \\frac{\\hat{V}_0}{2} \\left(e^{i\\omega_lt}+e^{-i\\omega_lt}\\right)\n$$\n\nWe will further assume the we would like use it to\nisolate the transition $i\\rightarrow f$, which is of frequency\n$\\hbar \\omega_0 = E_f - E_i$. The relevant quantity is then the detuning\n$\\delta = \\omega_0 - \\omega_L$. If it is much smaller than any other\nenergy difference $E_n-E_i$, we directly reduce the system to the\nfollowing closed system:\n\n$$\ni\\dot{\\gamma}_i = \\gamma_f \\mathrm{e}^{-i \\delta t} \\Omega\\\\\ni\\dot{\\gamma}_f = \\gamma_i \\mathrm{e}^{i \\delta t}\\Omega^*\n$$\n\nHere we defined\n$\\Omega = \\left\\langle i\\right| \\frac{\\hat{V_0}}{2\\hbar}\\left|f\\right\\rangle$.\nAnd to make it really a time-of the same form as the two-level system\nfrom the last lecture, we perform the transformation\n$\\gamma_f = \\tilde{\\gamma}_f e^{i\\delta t}$, which reduces the system\ntoo:\n\n$$\ni \\dot{\\gamma}_i = \\Omega \\tilde{\\gamma}_f \\\\\ni\\dot{\\tilde{\\gamma}}_f = \\delta \\tilde{\\gamma}_f + \\Omega^* \\gamma_i\n$$\n\nThis has exactly the form of the two-level system that\nwe studied previously.\n\n### Adiabatic elimination\n\nWe can now proceed to the quite important case of far detuning, where\n$\\delta \\gg \\Omega$. In this case, the final state\n$\\left|f\\right\\rangle$ gets barely populated and the time\nevolution can be approximated to to be zero [@lukin].\n\n$$\n\\dot{\\tilde{\\gamma}}_f = 0\n$$\n\nWe can use this equation to eliminate $\\gamma$ from the\ntime evolution of the ground state. This approximation is known as\n_adiabatic elimination_:\n\n$$\n\\tilde{\\gamma}_f = \\frac{\\Omega^*}{\\delta}\\gamma_i\\\\\n\\Rightarrow i\\hbar \\dot{\\gamma}_i = \\frac{|\\Omega|^2}{\\delta} \\tilde{\\gamma}_i\n$$\n\nThe last equation described the evolution of the initial\nstate with an energy $E_i = \\frac{|\\Omega|^2}{\\delta}$. If the Rabi\ncoupling is created through an oscillating electric field, i.e. a laser,\nthis is know as the **light shift** or the **optical dipole potential**.\nIt is this concept that underlies the optical tweezer for which Arthur\nAshkin got the [nobel prize in the 2018](https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/10/advanced-physicsprize2018.pdf).\n\n### Example: Atomic clocks in optical tweezers\n\nA neat example that ties the previous concepts together is [the recent\npaper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.05619v2). The experimental setup is visualized in the figure below.\n\n<img src=\"./lecture4_pic1.png\" width=\"90%\">\n\nWhile nice examples these clocks are still far away from the best clocks\nout there, which are based on [optical lattice clocks and ions](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/revmodphys.87.637).\n\n## Perturbative Solution\n\nThe more formal student might wonder at which points all these rather\nhefty approximation are actually valid, which is obviously a very\nsubstantial question. So, we will now try to isolate the most important\ncontributions to the complicated system through perturbation theory. For\nthat we will assume that we can write:\n\n$$\n\\hat{V}(t) =\\lambda \\hat{H}_1(t)\n$$\n\n, where $\\lambda$ is a small parameter. In other words\nwe assume that the initial system $\\hat{H}_0$ is only weakly perturbed.\nHaving identified the small parameter $\\lambda$, we make the\n_perturbative ansatz_\n\n$$\n    \\gamma_n(t) = \\gamma_n^{(0)} + \\lambda \\gamma_n^{(1)} + \\lambda^2 \\gamma_n^{(2)} + \\cdots\n$$\n\nand plug this ansatz in the evolution equations and sort\nthem by terms of equal power in $\\lambda$.\n\nThe $0$th order reads\n\n$$\n i\\hbar \\dot{\\gamma}_k^{(0)} = 0.\n$$\n\nThe $0$th order does not have a time evolution since we\nprepared it in an eigenstate of $\\hat{H}_0$.

    "title": "Lecture 5 - The Hydrogen Atom",
    "content": "\nIn this lecture we will first discuss the diagonalization of the\nharmonic oscillator and then discuss the main properties of the hydrogen\natom.\n\nIn the previous lectures we have seen how to treat eigenstates of the\ntwo-level system and then how we can derive its effective emergence from\nsome complex level structure if we apply oscillating\nfields.\n\nToday, we will increase the complexity towards the harmonic oscillator\nand the hydrogen atom.\n\n# The harmonic oscillator\n\nThe harmonic oscillator is another great toy model to understand certain\nproperties of quantum mechanical systems. Most importantly, it is a\ngreat introduction into the properties of bound systems and ladder\noperators. The basic Hamiltonian comes along in a rather innocent\nfashion, namely:\n\n$$\n\n\\hat{H} = \\frac{\\hat{p}^2}{2m}+ \\frac{m\\omega^2}{2}\\hat{x}^2\n$$\n\nThe two variables $\\hat{p}$ and $\\hat{x}$ are\nnon-commuting $[\\hat{x}, \\hat{p}] = i\\hbar$, so they cannot be measured\nat the same time. We would now like to put the operator into a diagonal\nform such that it reads something like:\n\n$$\n\n\\hat{H} = \\sum_n \\epsilon_n \\left|n\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle n\\right|\n$$\n\nWe will follow he quite closely [this discussion](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/nuclear-engineering/22-51-quantum-theory-of-radiation-interactions-fall-2012/lecture-notes/MIT22_51F12_Ch9.pdf).\n\n## The ladder operators\n\nWe would like to get the spectrum first. So make the equation look a bit\nnicer we will define $\\hat{p} = \\hat{P} \\sqrt{m\\omega}$ and\n$\\hat{x} = \\frac{\\hat{X}}{\\sqrt{m\\omega}}$ such that we have:\n\n$$\n\n\\hat{H} = \\frac{\\omega}{2}\\left(\\hat{P}^2 + \\hat{X}^2\\right)\n$$\n\n[^1] The next step is then to define the ladder\noperators:\n\n$$\n\\hat{a} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\hbar}}\\left(\\hat{X}+i\\hat{P}\\right)\\\\\n\\hat{a}^\\dag = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\hbar}}\\left(\\hat{X}-i\\hat{P}\\right)\\\\\n$$\n\nAt this stage we can just try to rewrite the Hamiltonian\nin terms of the operators, such that:\n\n$$\n\\hat{a}^\\dag \\hat{a} = \\frac{1}{2\\hbar}(\\hat{X}-i\\hat{P})(\\hat{X}+i\\hat{P})\\\\\n= \\frac{1}{2\\hbar}(\\hat{X}^2 +\\hat{P}^2 -\\hbar)\\\\\n \\frac{1}{2}(X^2 +\\hat{P}^2 ) = \\hbar \\left(\\hat{a}^\\dag \\hat{a}-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\n$$\n\nSo the Hamiltonian can now be written as:\n\n$$\n\\hat{H} = \\hbar \\omega \\left(\\hat{N} + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\text{ with } \\hat{N} = a^\\dag a\n$$\n\nAt this stage we have diagonalized the Hamiltonian, what\nremains to be understood is the the values that $\\hat{a}^\\dag a$ can\ntake.\n\n## Action of the ladder operators in the Fock basis\n\nWe would like to understand the basis, which is defined by:\n\n$$\n\\hat{N} \\left|n\\right\\rangle = n \\left|n\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nThe non-commutation between $\\hat{X}$ and $\\hat{P}$ is\ntranslated to the ladder operators as:\n\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{2\\hbar}[\\hat{X}+iP,\\hat{X}-i\\hat{P}] = 1\\\\\n~[\\hat{N}, a] = -\\hat{a}\\\\\n~[\\hat{N}, a^\\dag] = a^\\dag\n$$\n\nFrom these relationship we can show then that:\n\n$$\n\\hat{a}\\left|n\\right\\rangle = \\sqrt{n}\\left|n-1\\right\\rangle\\\\\n\\hat{a}^\\dag \\left|n\\right\\rangle = \\sqrt{n+1}\\left|n+1\\right\\rangle\\\\\n$$\n\nThese relations are the motivation for the name ladder\noperators as they connect the different eigenstates. And they are\nraising/lowering the quantum number by one. Finally we have to find the\nlower limit. And this is quite naturally 0 as\n$n = \\left\\langle n\\right|\\hat{N}\\left|n\\right\\rangle = \\left\\langle\\psi_1\\right|\\left|\\psi_1\\right\\rangle\\geq 0$.\nSo we can construct the full basis by just defining the action of the\nlowering operator on the zero element\n$a\\left|0\\right\\rangle = 0$ and the other operators are\nthen constructed as:\n\n$$\n\\left|n\\right\\rangle = \\frac{(a^\\dag)^n}{\\sqrt{n!}}\\left|0\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\n## Spatial representation of the eigenstates\n\nWhile we now have the spectrum it would be really nice to obtain the\nspatial properties of the different states. For that we have to project\nthem onto the x basis. Let us start out with the ground state for which\nwe have $\\hat{a}\\left|0\\right\\rangle= 0$:\n\n$$\n\\left\\langle x\\right|\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\hbar}}\\left(\\sqrt{m\\omega}\\hat{x} +i \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m\\omega}}\\hat{p}\\right)\\left|0\\right\\rangle= 0\\\\\n\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{m\\omega}{\\hbar}}x + \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar}{m\\omega}}\\partial_x\\right)\\psi_0(x)= 0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\psi_0(x) \\propto e^{-\\frac{x^2}{2a_{HO}^2}}\n$$\n\nThis also introduces the typical distance in the quantum\nharmonic oscillator which is given by $a_{HO} =\\sqrt{\\hbar/m\\omega}$.\nThe other states are solutions to the defining equations:\n\n$$\n\\psi_n(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n!}2^n}\\left(\\sqrt{m\\omega}x - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m\\omega}}\\frac{d}{dx}\\right)^n \\psi_0(x)\\\\\n\\psi_n(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n!}2^n}H_n(x) \\psi_0(x)\\\\\n$$\n\nwhere $H_n(x)$ are the Hermite polynoms.\n\n# The hamiltonian of the hydrogen atom\n\nThe hydrogen atom plays at central role in atomic physics as it is _the_\nbasic ingredient of atomic structures. It describes a single _electron_,\nwhich is bound to the nucleus of a single _proton_. As such it is the\nsimplest of all atoms and can be described analytically within high\nprecision. This has motivated an enormous body of literature on the\nproblem, which derives all imaginable properties in nauseating detail.\nTherefore, we will focus here on the main properties and only sketch the\nderivations, while we will reference to the more technical details.\n\n<img src=\"./lecture5_pic1.png\" width=\"60%\">\n\nSketch of the hydrogen atom with the relative coordinate and the\ncoordinates of the proton and the electron.\n\nFor the hydrogen atom as shown in above, we can write down the Hamiltonian\n\n$$\n\\hat{H}=\\frac{{{\\hat{\\vec{p}}}^2_\\text{p}}}{2m_\\text{p}} + \\frac{{\\hat{\\vec{p}}}^2_\\text{e}}{2m_\\text{e}} - \\frac{Ze^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 r},\n$$\n\nwhere $Ze$ is the nuclear charge. To solve the problem,\nwe have to find the right Hilbert space. We can not solve the problem of\nthe electron alone. If we do a separation of coordinates, i.e., we\nseparate the Hamiltonian into the the center of mass and the relative\nmotion, we get\n\n$$\n\\hat{H} = \\underbrace{\\frac{{\\hat{\\vec{p}}}^2_{\\textrm{cm}}}{2M}}_{\\hat{H}_{\\textrm{cm}}} + \\underbrace{\\frac{{\\hat{\\vec{p}}}^2_\\text{r}}{2\\mu}- \\frac{Ze^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0r}}_{\\hat{H}_{\\text{atom}}}\n$$\n\nwith the reduced mass $1/\\mu=1/m_\\text{e}+1/m_\\text{p}$.\nIf the state of the hydrogen atom $\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle$\nis an eigenstate of $\\hat{H}$, we can write\n\n$$\n\\hat{H}\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle=\\left(\\hat{H}_\\textrm{cm}+\\hat{H}_{\\text{atom}} \\right)\\left|\\psi_\\textrm{cm}\\right\\rangle\\otimes \\left|\\psi_\\text{atom}\\right\\rangle \\\\\n= \\left( E_{\\text{kin}} + E_\\text{atom} \\right) \\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle.\n$$\n\nBoth states are eigenstates of the system. The state\n$\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle$ can be split up as shown since\nthe two degrees of freedom are generally not entangled.\n\n![Sketch of the hydrogen atom with the relative coordinate and the\ncoordinates of the proton and the electron.\n](figures/Bildschirmfoto-2018-09-28-um-16-07-07/Bildschirmfoto-2018-09-28-um-16-07-07){#261310\nwidth=\"0.70\\\\columnwidth\"}\n\nThe wave function of the system then reads:\n\n$$\n\\psi(\\vec{R},\\vec{r}) = \\left( \\left\\langle R\\right| \\otimes \\left\\langle r\\right|\\right)\\left( \\left|\\psi_\\textrm{cm}\\right\\rangle \\otimes \\left|\\psi_{\\text{atom}}\\right\\rangle\\right)\\\\\n= \\psi(\\vec{R}) \\cdot \\psi (\\vec{r})\n$$\n\nOur goal is now to find the eigenfunctions and\neigenenergies of $\\hat{H}_\\text{atom}$. In order to further divide the\nHilbert space, we can use the symmetries.\n\n# Conservation of orbital angular momentum\n\n$\\hat{H}_\\text{atom}$ possesses spherical symmetry, which implies that\n**orbital angular momentum** $\\hat{\\vec{L}}$ is conserved. It is defined\nas:\n\n$$\n\\hat{\\vec{L}}=\\hat{\\vec{r}} \\times \\hat{\\vec{p}}\n$$\n\nIn other words, we have:\n\n$$\n= 0\n$$\n\nLet us show first that the kinetic term commutes with\nthe angular momentum operator, We will employ the commutator\nrelationships for position and momentum $[x_i, p_j]=i\\hbar$ and the\nrelationship $[A,BC] = [A,B]C+B[A,C]$ and\n$[f(x), p_x] = [x,p_x]\\frac{\\partial f(x)}{\\partial x}$. So we obtain:\n\n$$\n= [p_x^2,xp_y]-[p_y^2,yp_x] \\\\\n = [p_x^2,x]p_y-[p_y^2,y] p_x\\\\\n =i\\hbar 2 p_xp_y-2i\\hbar p_y p_x\\\\\n = 0\n$$\n\nAnalog calculations show that $L_y$ and $L_z$ commute.\nIn a similiar fashion we can verify that the potential term commutes\nwith the different components of $\\hat{\\vec{L}}$\n\n$$\n= [\\frac{1}{r}, xp_y]-[\\frac{1}{r}, yp_x]\\\\\n= x[\\frac{1}{r}, p_y]-y[\\frac{1}{r}, p_x]\\\\\n= -x \\frac{yi\\hbar}{2r^{3/2}}+y\\frac{xi\\hbar}{2r^{3/2}}\\\\\n=0\n$$\n\nWe can therefore decompose the eigenfunctions of the\nhydrogen atom over the eigenbasis of the angular momentum operator. A\ndetailled discussion of the properties of $\\vec{L}$ can be found in\n[Appendix B of Hertel](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-54322-7). To find the eigenbasis, we first need to\nidentify the commutation relationships between the components of\n$\\hat{\\vec{L}}$. We can calculate them following commutation\nrelationships:\n\n$$\n= [yp_z - zp_y, zp_x - xp_z]\\\\\n=[yp_z, zp_x]-[yp_z,xp_z]- [zp_y, zp_x] + [zp_y,xp_z]\\\\\n=[yp_z, zp_x] + [zp_y,xp_z]\\\\\n=[yp_z, z]p_x +x[zp_y,p_z]\\\\\n=-i\\hbar yp_x +i\\hbar xp_y\\\\\n= i\\hbar L_z\n$$\n\nThis relationship holds for all the other components too\nand we have in general:\n\n$$\n= i\\hbar \\epsilon_{ijk}L_k\n$$\n\nThe orbital angular momentum is therefore part of the\nlarge family of angular momentum operators, which also comprises spin\netc. In particular the different components are not independent, and\ntherefore we cannot form a basis out the three components. A suitable\nchoice is actually to use the following combinations:\n\n$$\n\\hat{\\vec{L}}^2\\left|l,m_l\\right\\rangle = \\hbar^2 l (l+1)\\left|l,m_l\\right\\rangle\\\\\n\\hat{L}_z\\left|l,m_l\\right\\rangle = \\hbar m_l \\left|l,m_l\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\n- $l$ is a non-negative integer and it is called the **orbital angular\n  momentum quantum number**.\n\n- $m_l$ takes values $-l, -l+1, ..., l-1, l$ and it is sometimes\n  called the **projection of the angular momentum**.\n\n## Eigenfunction of the angular momentum operators\n\nHaving identified the relevant operators it would be nice to obtain a\nspace representation of them. This works especially nicely in spherical\ncoordinates. There, we get\n\n$$\n\\hat{L}_z= - i \\hbar \\partial_{\\phi}\\\\\n\\hat{\\vec{L}}^2 = - \\hbar^2 \\left[\\frac{1}{\\sin(\\theta)}\\partial_{\\theta} \\left( \\sin(\\theta) \\partial_\\theta\\right) + \\frac{1}{\\sin^2(\\theta)} \\partial_{\\phi\\phi} \\right].\n$$\n\nThe corresponding wave functions are\n\n$$\n\\left\\langle\\theta, \\phi | l,m_l\\right\\rangle = Y_{lm}(\\theta,\\phi).\n$$\n\nWhere $Y_{lm}(\\theta, \\phi)$ are the **spherical harmonics**.\n\n# The radial wave equation\n\nGiven that we now know that the angular momentum is conserved for the\nhydrogen atom, we can actually rewrite the Hamltonian in terms of the angular momentum as\nwe find:\n\n$$\n\\hat{H}_\\text{atom} = \\hat{H}_r + \\frac{\\hat{L}}{2\\mu r^2}+V(r) \\\\\n\\hat{H}_r = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2\\mu}\\frac{1}{r^2}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\left(r^2\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\right)\n$$\n\nWe can now separate out the angular part and decompose\nit over the eigenfunctions of $\\hat{\\vec{L}}$, such that we make the\nansatz [^2]:\n\n$$\n\\psi (r,\\theta,\\phi) = R(r) Y_{lm}(\\theta,\\phi)\n$$\n\nWe can plug this separated ansatz in the Schr√∂dinger equation. We\nalready solved the angular in the discussion of the angular momentum and\nfor the radial part we obtain:\n\n$$\n-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2\\mu}\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{d^2(rR(r))}{dr^2} - \\frac{Ze^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 r} R(r) + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2\\mu}\\frac{l(l+1)}{r^2}R(r) = ER(r)\n$$\n\nSubstituting $R(r)=u(r)/r$ leads to\n\n$$\n-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2\\mu}\\frac{d^2}{dr^2}u(r) +\\underbrace{ \\left( -\\frac{Ze^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 r} + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2\\mu} \\frac{l(l+1)}{r^2} \\right)}_{V_{\\text{eff}}} u(r) = E \\, u(r),\n$$\n\nwhich is known as the \"radial wave equation\". It is a\nvery general result for _any_ central potential. It can also be used to\ndescribe unbound states ($E>0$) that occur during scattering.\n\nIn the next lecture we will look into the energy scales of the hydrogen atom and then start\ncoupling different levels.\n\n[^1]:\n    The commutator between $\\hat{X}$ and $\\hat{P}$ is still as for $x$\n    and $p$.\n\n[^2]:\n    Only if the system is in a well-defined angular momentum state, we\n    can write it down like this.",

    "content": "\nIn this lecture we will use the hydrogen atom to study static\nperturbations in form of external magnetic fields and relativistic\neffects, leading to the fine structure splitting.\n\nWe spend quite some time on the properties of the hydrogen atom in the\nprevious lectures [@Jendrzejewski; @atom]. However, we completely\nneglected any effects of quantum-electrodynamics and relativistic\nphysics. In this lecture we will study, why this is a good approximation\nfor the hydrogen atom and then investigate in a perturbative fashion the\nterms. Most importantly, we will introduce that coupling between the\norbital angular momentum and the spin of the electron, which leads to\nthe fine splitting.\n\n## Perturbation theory\n\nUp to now have studied the hydrogen atom to find its eigensystem and\nthen studied how it evolves under the presence of oscillating electric\nfields. This allowed us to understand in more detail the idea of\neigenstates and then of time-dependent perturbation theory. However, one\nof the most important concepts that can be introduced very nicely on the\nhydrogen atom is stationnary perturbation theory in form of external\nmagnetic fields or relativistic corrections. We will remind you of\nperturbation theory here and then apply it to some simple cases.\n\nWe can now simply write down the problem as:\n\n$$\n\\left(\\hat{H}_0+\\lambda \\hat{W}\\right)\\left|\\psi_m\\right\\rangle = E_m\\left|\\psi_m\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\n$\\lambda$ is a very small parameter and $\\hat{H}_0$ is\ndescribing the hydrogen atom system. We will note the eigenvalues and\neigenstates of this system as:\n\n$$\n\n\\hat{H}_0\\left|\\varphi_n\\right\\rangle = \\epsilon_n \\left|\\varphi_n\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nWhile, we do not know the exact solution of\n$\\left|\\psi_m\\right\\rangle$ and the energy $E_m$, we decide\nto decompose them in the following expansion of the small parameter\n$\\lambda$:\n\n$$\n\\left|\\psi_m\\right\\rangle = \\left|\\psi_m^{(0)}\\right\\rangle + \\lambda\\left|\\psi_m^{(1)}\\right\\rangle+\\lambda^2\\left|\\psi_m^{(2)}\\right\\rangle+O(\\lambda^3)\\\\\nE_m = E_m^{(0)} +\\lambda E_m^{(1)} + \\lambda^2 E_m^{(2)}+O(\\lambda^3)\\,\n$$\n\nTo zeroth order in $\\lambda$ we obtain:\n\n$$\n\\hat{H}_0\\left|\\psi_m^{(0)}\\right\\rangle = E_m^{(0)}\\left|\\psi_m^{(0)}\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nSo it is just the unperturbed system and we can\nidentify:\n\n$$\n\\left|\\psi_m^{(0)}\\right\\rangle = \\left|\\varphi_m\\right\\rangle~~E_m^{(0)} = \\epsilon_m\n$$\n\nFor the first order we have to solve\n\n$$\n\n(\\hat{H}_0-E_m^{(0)}) \\left|\\psi_m^{(1)}\\right\\rangle + (\\hat{W}-E_m^{(1)})\\left|\\psi_m^{(0)}\\right\\rangle= 0\\\\\n(\\hat{H}_0-\\epsilon_m) \\left|\\psi_m^{(1)}\\right\\rangle + (\\hat{W}-E_m^{(1)})\\left|\\varphi_m\\right\\rangle= 0\n$$\n\nWe can multiply the whole equation by\n$\\left\\langle\\varphi_m\\right|$ from the right. As\n$\\left\\langle\\varphi_m\\right|\\hat{H}_0= \\epsilon_m\\left\\langle\\varphi_m\\right|$,\nthe first term cancels out. Hence, we obtain:\n\n$$\n\n\\boxed{E_m^{(1)} = \\left\\langle\\varphi_m\\right|\\hat{W}\\left|\\varphi_m\\right\\rangle}\n$$\n\nWe now also need to obtain the correction to the\neigenstate. For that, we put the solution for the energy into the Ansatz to obain:\n\n$$\n(\\hat{H}_0-\\epsilon_m) \\left|\\psi_m^{(1)}\\right\\rangle + (\\hat{W}\\left|\\varphi_m\\right\\rangle-\\left|\\varphi_m\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle\\varphi_m\\right|\\hat{W}\\left|\\varphi_m\\right\\rangle)= 0\n$$\n\nWe can now multiply the whole equation by\n$\\left\\langle\\varphi_i\\right|$ from the right and obtain:\n\n$$\n(\\epsilon_i-\\epsilon_m)\\left\\langle\\varphi_i\\right|\\left|\\psi_m^{(1)}\\right\\rangle+\\left\\langle\\varphi_i\\right|\\hat{W}\\left|\\varphi_m\\right\\rangle = 0\n$$\n\nBy rewriting the above equation, this directly gives us\nthe decompositon of the $\\left|\\psi_m^{(1)}\\right\\rangle$\nonto the original eigenstates and have:\n\n$$\n\n\\boxed{\\left|\\psi_m^{(1)}\\right\\rangle = \\sum_{i\\neq m} \\frac{\\left\\langle\\varphi_i\\right|\\hat{W}\\left|\\varphi_m\\right\\rangle}{(\\epsilon_m-\\epsilon_i)}\\left|\\varphi_i\\right\\rangle}\n$$\n\nAnd we end the calculation with second order pertubation\nin $\\lambda$\n\n$$\n(\\hat{H}_0-E_m^{(0)}) \\left|\\psi_m^{(2)}\\right\\rangle + (\\hat{W}-E_m^{(1)})\\left|\\psi_m^{(1)}\\right\\rangle-E_m^{(2)} \\left|\\psi_m^{(0)}\\right\\rangle= 0\\\\\n(\\hat{H}_0-\\epsilon_m) \\left|\\psi_m^{(2)}\\right\\rangle + (\\hat{W}-E_m^{(1)})\\left|\\psi_m^{(1)}\\right\\rangle-E_m^{(2)} \\left|\\varphi_m\\right\\rangle= 0\\\\\n$$\n\nWe can multiply once again whole equation by\n$\\left\\langle\\varphi_m\\right|$ from the right, which\ndirectly drops the first term. The term\n$E_m^{(1)}\\left\\langle\\varphi_m\\right|\\left|\\psi_m^{(1)}\\right\\rangle$\ndrops out as the first order perturbation does not contain a projection\nonto the initial state. So we can write:\n\n$$\nE_m^{(2)}= \\left\\langle\\varphi_m\\right|\\hat{W}\\left|\\psi_m^{(1)}\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nPlugging in our solution, we obtain:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{E_m^{(2)} = \\sum_{i\\neq m} \\frac{|\\left\\langle\\varphi_i\\right|\\hat{W}\\left|\\varphi_m\\right\\rangle|^2}{(\\epsilon_m-\\epsilon_i)}}\n$$\n\n## Static external magnetic fields\n\nA first beautiful application of perturbation theory is the study of\nstatic magnetic fields (see Ch 1.9 and Ch. 2.7.1 of [@Hertel_2015] for\nmore details). The motion of the electron around the nucleus implies a\nmagnetic current\n\n$$\nI = \\frac{e}{t} = \\frac{ev}{2\\pi r}\n$$\n\nand this implies a magnetic moment $M = I A$, with the\nenclosed surface $A=\\pi r^2$. It may be rewritten as:\n\n$$\n\\vec{M}_L = -\\frac{e}{2m_e}\\vec{L} =-\\frac{\\mu_B}{\\hbar} \\vec{L} \\\\\n\\mu_B = \\frac{\\hbar e}{2m_e}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mu_B$ is the **Bohr magneton**. Its potential\nenergy in a magnetic field $\\vec{B} = B_0 \\vec{e}_z$ is then:\n\n$$\nV_B = -\\vec{M}_L\\cdot \\vec{B}\\\\\n= \\frac{\\mu_B}{\\hbar} L_z B_0\n$$\n\nIts contribution is directly evaluated from the expression on first oder pertubation theory to be:\n\n$$\nE_{Zeeman} = \\mu_B m B_0\n$$\n\nThis is the Zeeman splitting of the different magnetic\nsubstates. It is visualized below\n\n<img src=\"./lecture7_pic1.png\" width=\"70%\">\n\nThe Zeeman effect in the hydrogen atom.\n\n## Trapping with electric or magnetic fields\n\nWe have now investigated the structure of the hydrogen atom and seen how\nits energy gets shifted in external magnetic fields. We can combine this\nunderstanding to study conservative traps for atoms and ions. Neutral\natoms experience the external field:\n\n$$\nE_{mag}(x,y) = \\mu_B m B_0(x,y)\n$$\n\nFor ions on the other hand we have fully charged\nparticles. So they simply experience the external electric field\ndirectly:\n\n$$\nE_{el}(x,y) = -q E(x,y)\n$$\n\nTrapping atoms and ions has to be done under very good vacuum such that\nthey are well isolate from the enviromnent and high precision\nexperiments can be performed.\n\nHowever, the trap construction is not trivial given Maxwells equation\n$\\text{div} \\vec{E} = 0$ and $\\text{div} \\vec{B} = 0$. So, the\nexperimentalists have to play some tricks with oscillating fields. We\nwill not derive in detail how a resulting **Paul trap** works, but the\n[linked video](https://youtu.be/Xb-zpM0UOzk) gives a very nice\nimpression of the idea behind it. A sketch is presented in Fig.\n\n<img src=\"./lecture7_pic2.png\" width=\"70%\">\n\nThe upper stage shows the phases of The two phases of the oscillating\nelectric field of a Paul trap. Taken\nfrom¬†[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrupole_ion_trap).\nBelow we can see a linear ion (Paul) trap containing six calcium 40\nions. Taken\nfrom¬†[here](https://quantumoptics.at/en/research/lintrap.html).\n\nThis work on trapping ions dates back to the middle of the last century\n(!!!) and was recognized by the[ Nobel prize in\n1989](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1989/summary/) for\n[Wolfgang Paul](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/revmodphys.62.531) and[Hans Dehmelt](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/revmodphys.62.525). They shared\nthe prize with Norman Ramsey, who developped extremely precise\nspectroscopic methods, now known [as Ramsey spectroscopy](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/revmodphys.62.541).\n\nFor atoms we can play similiar games with magnetic traps. Again we have\nto solve the problem of the zero magnetic fields. Widely used\nconfigurations are the Ioffe-Pritchard trap, where quadrupole fields are\nsuperposed [with a bias field](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/physrevlett.51.1336), or [TOP-traps](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/physrevlett.74.3352).\n\nIon traps are now the basis of ionic quantum computers and\nmagnetic traps paved the way for quantum simulators with cold atoms as will see later on.\n\n### What we missed from the Dirac equation\n\nUntil now we have completely neglected relativistic effects, i.e. we\nshould have really solved the Dirac equation instead of the Schr√∂dinger\nequation. However, this is is major task, which we will not undertake\nhere. But what were the main approximations ?\n\n1.  We neglected the existance of the electron spin.\n\n2.  We did not take into account the relativistic effects.\n\nSo, how does relativity affect the hydrogen spectrum? In a first step,\nwe should actually introduce the magnetic moment of the spin:\n\n$$\n\\vec{M}_S = -g_e \\mu_B \\frac{\\vec{S}}{\\hbar}\n$$\n\nThe spin of the electron is $1/2$, making it a fermion\nand the _g factor of the electron_ reads\n\n$$\ng_e \\approx 2.0023\n$$\n\nFurther discussions of the g-factor might be found in\n[Chapter 6.6 of Hertel](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-54322-7).\n\n#### Amplitude of the relativistic effects\n\nWe saw in the previous lectures, that the\nenergy levels of hydrogenlike atoms are given by:\n\n$$\n\nE_n = \\frac{Z^2 R_{y,\\infty}}{n^2}\\\\\nR_{y,\\infty} = \\frac{m_e e^4}{32 \\pi^2 \\epsilon_0^2 \\hbar^2}\n$$\n\nWe can now use the fine-structure constant, which\nmeasures the coupling strength of the electric charges to the\nelectromagnetic field:\n\n$$\n\n\\alpha = \\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0\\hbar c}\\\\\n= \\frac{1}{137.035999139(31)}\n$$\n\nWe can now rewrite the energies of the hydrogen atom as:\n\n$$\nE_n = \\frac{1}{2} \\underbrace{m_e c^2}_{\\text{rest mass energy}} Z^2 \\alpha^2 \\frac{1}{n^2}\n$$\n\nHere, $m_e c^2\\approx 511\\textrm{k eV}$ is the rest\nmass energy of the electron. $E_n \\approx 10\\text{eV}$ on the other hand\nis the energy of the bound state and therefore in the order of the\nkinetic energy of the electron. As long as it is much smaller than the\nrest-mass of the electron, we can neglect the relativistic effects. A\nfew observations:\n\n- Relativistic effects are most pronounced for deeply bound states of\n  small quantum number $n$.\n\n- Relativistic effects effects will become important once\n  $(Z\\alpha)\\approx 1$, so they will play a major role in heavy\n  nuclei.\n\nFor the hydrogen atom we can thus treat the relativistic effects in a\nperturbative approach.But the most important consequence of the\nrelativistic terms is actually the existance of the electron spin.\n\n### The relativistic mass and Darwin term\n\n1.  \"Relativistic mass\": The relativistic relation between energy and\n    momentum reads:\n\n$$\n    E_\\text{rel} = \\sqrt{(mc^2)^2+(\\vec{p}c)^2}\\\\\n    \\approx mc^2 + \\frac{p^2}{2m}- \\frac{\\vec{p}^{\\,4}}{8m^3c^2} + \\cdots\n$$\n\nThe first two terms of the expansion are the\nnonrelativistic limit and the third term is the first correction.\nTherefore, the corresponding Hamiltonian is:\n\n$$\n    \\hat{H}_\\text{rm} = - \\frac{\\hat{\\vec{p}}^{\\,4}}{8m^3c^2}.\n$$\n\n2.  Darwin term: If $r=0$, the potential $V(r)$ diverges to $-\\infty$.\n    We get:\n\n$$\n    \\hat{H}_\\text{Darwin} = \\frac{\\pi \\hbar^2}{2m^2c^2}\\left( \\frac{Ze^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\right) \\delta(\\hat{\\vec{r}})\n$$\n\nIf we perform a first correction to the energy of the eigenstates\n$\\left\\langle n,l,m\\right\\rangle$ by calculating\n\n$$\n\\left\\langle n,l,m|\\hat{H'|n,l,m}\\right\\rangle,\n$$\n\nwe find that it works perfectly for case (1) and (2)\nwhich is due to degeneracy. $\\hat{H}_\\text{rm}$ and\n$\\hat{H}_\\text{Darwin}$ commute with all observables forming the\ncomplete set of commuting observables (CSCO) for $\\hat{H}_0$\n\n$$\n\\hat{H}_0,\\hat{\\vec{L}}^2, \\hat{L}_z,\n$$\n\nwith states described by $\\left|n,l,m\\right\\rangle$.",

Finally, we will introduce the\nvariational method for the estimation of the ground state energy.\n\nIn todays lecture, we will see how the electron spin couples to the\norbital angular momentum and how this creates spin-orbit coupling. We\nwill then start out with the discussion of the Helium atom.\n\n## Spin-orbit coupling\n\nThe third term, which arises from the Dirac equation is the spin-orbit\ncoupling. We will give here a common hand-waving explanation in a\nsimiliar spirit to the discussion of the magnetic moment [for given\nangular momentum](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-10298-1). Please, be aware that it misses a\nfactor of 2. The electron has a spin 1/2 and hence a magnetic moment\n$\\vec{M}_S = -g_e \\mu_B \\frac{\\vec{S}}{\\hbar}$.

We have to include the spin degree of freedom into the\ndescription. Let us repeat the same procedure for the spin projection:\n\n$$\n= [S_z, L_x S_x + L_y S_y + L_z S_z]\\\\\n[S_z, \\vec{L}\\cdot \\vec{S}] = L_x [S_z,  S_x] + L_y [S_z,  S_y]\\\\\n[S_z, \\vec{L}\\cdot \\vec{S}] = i\\hbar L_x S_y -i\\hbar L_y S_x\\neq 0\n$$\n\nThis implies that the spin projection is not a conserved\nquantity either. However, the sum of spin and orbital angular momentum\nwill commute $[L_z + S_z, \\vec{L}\\vec{S}] =0$ according to the above\ncalculations. Similiar calculations hold for the other components,\nindicating that the _total angular momentum_ is conserved [^2]:\n\n$$\n\\vec{J} = \\vec{L} + \\vec{S}\n$$\n\nWe can now rewrite $\\hat{H}_{LS}$ in terms of the conserved quantities through the following following\nlittle trick:\n\n$$\n\\hat{\\vec{J}}^2 = \\left( \\hat{\\vec{L}} + \\hat{\\vec{S}} \\right) ^2 = \\hat{\\vec{L}}^2 + 2 \\hat{\\vec{L}} \\cdot \\hat{\\vec{S}} + \\hat{\\vec{S}}^2\\\\\n\\hat{\\vec{L}} \\cdot \\hat{\\vec{S}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\hat{\\vec{J}}^2 - \\hat{\\vec{L}}^2 - \\hat{\\vec{S}}^2 \\right)\n$$\n\nThis directly implies that $\\hat{J}^2$, $\\hat{L}^2$ and $\\hat{S}^2$ are\nnew conserved quantities of the system. If we call $\\hat{H}_0$ the\nHamiltonian of the hydrogen atom, we previously used the complete set of\ncommuting observables [^3]:\n\n$$\n\\left\\{ \\hat{H}_0, \\hat{\\vec{L}}^2, \\hat{L}_z,\\hat{\\vec{S}}^2, \\hat{S}_z \\right\\}\n$$\n\nWe now use the complete set of commuting observables:\n\n$$\n\\left\\{ \\hat{H}_0 + \\hat{H}_{LS}, \\hat{\\vec{L}}^2,\\hat{\\vec{S}}^2, \\hat{\\vec{J}}^2, \\hat{J}_z \\right\\}.\n$$\n\nThe corresponding basis states\n$\\left|n,l,j,m_j\\right\\rangle$ are given by:\n\n$$\n\\left|n,l,j,m_j\\right\\rangle = \\sum_{m_l,m_s} \\left|n, l, m_l, m_s\\right\\rangle \\underbrace{\\left\\langle n, l, m_l, m_s | n, l, j, m_j\\right\\rangle}_{\\text{Clebsch-Gordan coefficients}}\n$$\n\nHere, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients (cf. [Olive 2014 p. 557](http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1674-1137/38/9/090001) or the [PDG](http://pdg.lbl.gov/2002/clebrpp.pdf))\ndescribe the coupling of angular momentum states.\n\n**Example: $l=1$ and $s=1/2$.**\n\nWith the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, the following example\nstates---given by $Jj$ and $m_j$---can be expressed by linear\ncombinations of states defined by $m_l$ and $m_s$:\n\n$$\n\\left|j=\\frac{3}{2}, m_j = \\frac{3}{2}\\right\\rangle = \\left|m_l=1, m_s = +\\frac{1}{2}\\right\\rangle\\\\\n\\left|j=\\frac{3}{2}, m_j = \\frac{1}{2}\\right\\rangle = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3}} \\left|m_l=1, m_s = -\\frac{1}{2}\\right\\rangle +\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}} \\left|m_l = 0, m_s = +\\frac{1}{2}\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\n### Summary of the relativistic shifts\n\nWe can now proceed to a summary of the relativistic effects in the\nhydrogen atom as presented in Fig.\n\n<img src=\"./lecture8_pic1.png\" width=\"70%\"/>\n\nFine structure of the Hydrogen atom. Adapted from¬†[Demtr√∂der 2010 Fig. 5.33](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-10298-1)\n\n- The states should be characterized by angular momentum anymore, but\n  by the total angular momentum $J$ and the orbital angular momentum.\n  We introduce the notation:\n\n$$\n    nl_{j}\n$$\n\n- All shifts are on the order of $\\alpha^2$ and hence pertubative.\n\n- Some levels remain degenerate in relativistic theory, most\n  importantly the $2s_{1/2}$ and the $2p_{1/2}$ state.\n\n## The Lamb shift\n\nThe previous discussions studied the effects of the Dirac equation onto\nour understanding of the Hydrogen atom. Most importantly, we saw that we\ncan test those predictions quite well through the shifts in the level\nscheme. It is possible to push this analysis even further. One\nparticularly important candidate here are the degenerate levels\n$2s_{1/2}$ and $2p_{1/2}$. Being able to see any splitting here, will be\nproof physics beyond the Dirac equation. And it is a relative\nmeasurement, for which it therefore not necessary to have insane\nabsolute precisions. It is exactly this measurement that [Lamb and\nRetherford undertook in 1947](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/physrev.72.241). They observed actually a\nsplitting of roughly $1$GHz, which they drove through direct\nrf-transitions. The observed shift was immediately [explained by Bethe](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/physrev.72.339) through the idea of QED a concept that we will come back\nto later in this lecture in a much simpler context of cavity QED.\n\nWe would simply like to add here that the long story of the hydrogen\natom and the Lamb shift is far from over as open questions remained\nuntil September 2019. Basically, a group of people measured the radius\nin some 'heavy' muonic hydrogen very [precisely in 2010](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature09250).\nThey could only explain them by changing the size of the proton radius,\nwhich was previously assumed to be well measured. It was only this year\nthe another team reperformed a similiar measurement on electronic\nhydrogen (the normal one), [obtaining consistent results](http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.aau7807). A nice summary of the \\\"proton radius puzzle\\\" can be\nfound [here](https://www.quantamagazine.org/physicists-finally-nail-the-protons-size-and-hope-dies-20190911/).\n\n## The helium problem\n\nIn this lecture we will discuss the Helium atom and what makes it so\ninteresting in the laboratory. We will most importantly see that you\ncannot solve the problem exactly. This makes it a great historical\nexample where a simple system was used to test state-of-the-art\ntheories. An extensive discussion can be found in Chapter 7 of Bransden [^Bransden] or [Chapter 6 of Demtr√∂der 20210](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-10298-1). Even nowadays, the system continues to be a nice test-bed of many-body theories, see for example the paper by [Combescot in 2017](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/physrevx.7.041035) or by [Ott in 2019](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/physrevlett.123.203401)..\n\nThe Helium atom describes a two electron system as shown in the figure\nbelow.\n\n<img src=\"./lecture8_pic2.svg\" width=\"70%\"/>\n\nThe helium atom describes two electrons coupled to the nucleus of\ncharge Z=2.\n\nIn the reference frame of center-of-mass we obtain the following\nHamiltonian:\n$$H = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2\\mu}\\nabla_{r_1}^2 -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2\\mu}\\nabla_{r_2}^2-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{M}\\nabla_{r_1}\\cdot\\nabla_{r_2}+\\frac{e^2}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0}\\left(-\\frac{Z}{r_1}-\\frac{Z}{r_2}+\\frac{1}{r_{12}}\\right)$$\n\nThe term in the middle is the mass polarization term. We further\nintroduced the reduced mass $$\\mu = \\frac{m_eM}{m_e + M}$$ For the very\nlarge mass differences $M= 7300 m_e \\gg m_e$, we can do two\nsimplifications:\n\n- Omit the term on the mass polarization.\n\n- Set the reduced mass to the mass of the electron.\n\nSo we obtain the simplified Hamiltonian\n$$H = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m_e}\\nabla_{r_1}^2 -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m_e}\\nabla_{r_2}^2+\\frac{e^2}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0}\\left(-\\frac{Z}{r_1}-\\frac{Z}{r_2}+\\frac{1}{r_{12}}\\right)$$\n\n## Natural units\n\nFor simplicity it is actually nice to work in the so-called **natural\nunits**, where we measure all energies and distance on typical scales.\nWe will start out by measuring all distances in units of $a_0$, which is\ndefined as:\n$$a_0 = \\frac{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 \\hbar^2}{me^2} = 0.5\\text{angstrom}$$ So\nwe can introduce the replacement: $$\\mathbf{r} = \\mathbf{\\tilde{r}}a_0$$\nSo the Hamiltonian reads:\n\n$$\nH = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m_ea_0^2}\\nabla_{\\tilde{r}_1}^2 -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m_ea_0^2}\\nabla_{\\tilde{r}_2}^2+\\frac{e^2}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 a_0}\\left(-\\frac{Z}{\\tilde{r}_1}-\\frac{Z}{\\tilde{r}_2}+\\frac{1}{\\tilde{r}_{12}}\\right)\\\\\nH = -\\frac{e^4 m}{2(4\\pi\\epsilon_0)^2 \\hbar^2}\\nabla_{\\tilde{r}_1}^2 -\\frac{e^4 m}{2(4\\pi\\epsilon_0)^2 \\hbar^2}\\nabla_{\\tilde{r}_2}^2+\\frac{e^4 m}{(4\\pi \\epsilon_0)^2\\hbar^2}\\left(-\\frac{Z}{\\tilde{r}_1}-\\frac{Z}{\\tilde{r}_2}+\\frac{1}{\\tilde{r}_{12}}\\right)\n$$\n\nAnd finally we can measure all energies in units of\n$$E_0 = \\frac{e^4 m}{(4\\pi\\epsilon_0)^2\\hbar^2} = 1\\text{hartree} = 27.2\\text{eV}$$\nSo the Hamiltonian reads in these natural units:\n\n$$\n\\tilde{H} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\nabla_{\\tilde{r}_1}^2 -\\frac{1}{2}\\nabla_{\\tilde{r}_2}^2+\\left(-\\frac{Z}{\\tilde{r}_1}-\\frac{Z}{\\tilde{r}_2}+\\frac{1}{\\tilde{r}_{12}}\\right)\n$$\n\nAnother, more common, way of introducing this is to define:\n\n$$\nm = \\hbar = e = 4\\pi \\epsilon_0 \\equiv 1\\\\\n\\alpha = \\frac{e^2}{(4\\pi \\epsilon_0) \\hbar c}= \\frac{1}{137}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow c = \\frac{1}{\\alpha}\n$$\n\nWithin these units we have for the hydrogen atom:\n$$E_n = \\frac{Z^2}{2}\\frac{1}{n^2}E_0$$\n\n**For the remainder of this lecture we will assume that we are working\nin natural units and just omit the tildas.**\n\n## Electron-electron interaction\n\nNow we can decompose the Hamiltonian in the following fashion:\n$$H = H_1 + H_2 + H_{12}$$ So without the coupling term between the\nelectrons we would just have once again two hydrogen atoms. The whole\ncrux is now that the term $H_{12}$ is actually coupling or\n**entangling** the two electrons.\n\n## Symmetries\n\nThe **exchange** operator is defined as:\n\n$$\nP_{12}\\psi(r_1,r_2) = \\psi(r_2, r_1)\n$$\n\nWe directly see for the Hamiltonian of Helium in the reduced units that the exchange operator commutes with\nthe Hamiltonian, $[H,P_{12}] = 0$. This implies directly that the parity\nis a conserved quantity of the system and that we have a set of\nEigenstates associated with the parity.\n\nWe can now apply the operator twice:\n\n$$\nP_{12}^2\\psi(r_1,r_2) = \\lambda^2 \\psi(r_1, r_2) = \\psi(r_1, r_2)\n$$\n\nSo we can see that there are two sets of eigenvalues with\n$\\lambda = \\pm 1$.\n\n$$\nP_{12}\\psi_\\pm = \\pm \\psi_\\pm\n$$\n\nWe will call:\n\n- $\\psi_+$ are para-states\n\n- $\\psi_-$ are ortho-states\n\nThis symmetry is a really strong one and it was only recently that\ndirect transitions between [ortho and para-states were observed](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/physrevlett.119.173401). Interestingly, we did not need to look into the spin\nand the Pauli principle for this discussion at all. This will happen in\nthe next step.\n\n## Spin and Pauli principle\n\nWe have seen that the Hamiltonian does not contain the spin degree of\nfreedom. So we can decompose the total wave function as:\n\n$$\n\\overline{\\psi} = \\psi(\\mathbf{r}_1, \\mathbf{r}_2) \\cdot \\chi(1,2)\n$$\n\n### Spin degree of freedom\n\nGiven that the electron is $s=\\frac{1}{2}$, we can decompose each\nwavefunction as:\n$$\\chi = \\alpha |\\uparrow\\rangle + \\beta |\\downarrow\\rangle$$ So if the\ntwo spins were _not_ correlated, we could just write the spin\nwavefunction as: $$\\chi(1,2) = \\chi_\\mathrm{1}\\cdot\\chi_\\mathrm{2}$$\nHowever, the electron-electron interaction entangles the atoms. An\nexample would be the singlet state:\n$$\\chi(1,2) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(|\\uparrow \\downarrow\\rangle - |\\downarrow\\uparrow \\rangle\\right)$$\n\nTo construct the full wave function we need to take into account the\n_Pauli_ principle, which telles us for Fermions that the _full_\nwavefunction should anti-sysmmetrc under exchange of particles:\n\n$$\n\\overline{\\psi}(q_1, q_2, \\cdots, q_i,\\cdots,  q_j, \\cdots) =\n-\\overline{\\psi}(q_1, q_2, \\cdots, q_j,\\cdots,  q_i, \\cdots)\n$$\n\nThis tells us that each quantum state can be only occupied by a single\nelectron at maximum.\n\nNow we can come back to the full wavefunction using the results of the\nprevious section. We have:\n\n$$\n\\overline{\\psi}(1,2) = \\psi_{\\pm}(r_1,r_2)\\chi_\\mp(1,2)\n$$\n\nwith\n$P_{12}\\chi_\\pm = \\pm \\chi_\\pm$. Now can once again look for good\nsolutions to this problem. It is basically the total spin\n$\\mathbf{S} = \\mathbf{S}_1 + \\mathbf{S}_2$, or better $\\mathbf{S}^2$.\nThis commutes with both the Hamiltonian and the parity operator, so it\nis a conserved quantity. Sorting out the solutions we have\n\n$$\n\n\\chi*- = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(|\\uparrow\\downarrow\\rangle - |\\downarrow\\uparrow\\rangle\\right)\\\\\n\\chi*{+,1} = |\\uparrow\\uparrow\\rangle \\\\\n\\chi*{+,1} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(|\\uparrow\\downarrow\\rangle + |\\downarrow\\uparrow\\rangle\\right) \\\\\n\\chi*{+,-1} = |\\downarrow\\downarrow\\rangle \\\\\n\n\n$$\n\nSo $\\chi_+$ is associated with spin 1 and $\\chi_-$ is\nassociated with spin 0.\n\n[^1]: It's proper derivation is left to quantum field theory lectures\n\n[^2]: It should be as there is no external torque acting on the atom\n\n[^3]: see lecture 2 for a few words on the definition of such a set\n\n[^Bransden]: Brian Harold Bransden, Charles Jean Joachain.

    "title": "Lecture 9 - More on the Helium atom",
    "content": "\nWe will finish our discussion of the Helium atom. Most importantly, we\nwill dive into the strong separation between singlet and triplet states.\n\nIn the last lecture, we saw some important properties\nof the He atom:\n\n- Total angular momentum, spin and the electronic quantum number are\n  labelling the states.\n\n- The exchange symmetry introduces the important distinction between\n  ortho and para-states.\n\nToday, we will see how this exchange symmetry enters the level scheme\nand how it is linked to the spin.\n\n# Level scheme\n\nWe can now continue through the level scheme of Helium and try to\nunderstand our observations. No radiative transitions between $S=0$ and\n$S=1$, which means that we will basically have two independent schemes.\nThey are characterized by:\n\n- electronic excitations, which are the main quantum numbers $N$.\n\n- orbital angular momentum, with quantum number $L$.\n\n- total spin with quantum number $S$\n\n- total angular momentum $J$, but the spin-orbit coupling in Helium is\n  actually extremly small.\n\nWe will then use the term notation: $$N ^{2S+1}L_J$$ the superscript is\ngiving the multiplicity or the number of different $J$ levels.\n\nHaving the level structure, we are now able to calculate the energies of\nthe different states. We will start out with the ground state and then\nwork our way through the excited states.\n\n# Independent particle model\n\nWe will now go back to the influence of the interaction on the\neigenenergies of the system. Going back to the Helium atoms, we will\ntreat the single particle Hamiltonians as unperturbed system and\n$H_{12}$ as the perturbation:\n\n$$\nH_0 = -\\frac{1}{2}\\nabla_{r_1}^2 -\\frac{Z}{r_1} -\\frac{1}{2}\\nabla_{r_2}^2 -\\frac{Z}{r_2}\\\\\nH_1 =\\frac{1}{r_{12}}\n$$\n\nWe now know the solutions to $H_0$, because the\nfactorize:\n\n$$\n\\left(\\hat{H}_1 + \\hat{H}_2\\right)|\\psi_1\\rangle\\otimes|\\psi_2\\rangle =\n\\left(E_1 + E_2\\right)|\\psi_1\\rangle\\otimes|\\psi_2\\rangle\n$$\n\n## Groundstate energy - perturbative approach\n\nAt this stage we can try to calculate the groundstate energy. We can\nderive that the unperturbed energy reads: $$E_0^{(0)}= Z^2\\text{hartree}$$\nThe electron interaction leads within first order perturbation theory to\nan energy shift of:\n$$E_0^{(1)}= \\langle\\psi_0|\\frac{1}{r_{12}}|\\psi_0\\rangle = \\frac{5}{8}Z$$\nWe can see that the first order energy shift is actually not that small,\nso we might start to question perturbation theory.\n\n## Groundstate energy - variational approach\n\nIn the variational approach, we will try to find the minimal energy of\nthe ground state. Namely we will minimize:\n$$E_{var} = \\frac{\\langle\\psi|\\hat{H}|\\psi\\rangle}{\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle}$$\nWe can actually proof that this works nicely within a few lines. For\nthat we will expand our trial function $|\\psi\\rangle$ into the (unknown)\neigenstates of $\\hat{H}$: $$|\\psi\\rangle = \\sum_n c_n |\\psi_n\\rangle$$\nFor the energies this implies:\n$$\\hat{H}|\\psi_n\\rangle = E_n|\\psi_n\\rangle$$ So we end up with:\n\n$$\n\\langle \\psi|H|\\psi\\rangle - E_0 = \\sum_n E_n c_n^*c_n - E_0 \\sum_n c_n^*c_n\\\\\n= \\sum_n (E_n-E_0)|c_n|^2 \\geq 0\n$$\n\nSo the variational principle always gives an upper bound\non the ground state energy. The question is how good is this bound in\neach individual case.\n\nTo apply the variational approach, we will introduce a variational\nparameter. This parameter is typically guessed from physical intuition.\nHere it will be the charge, which will be replaced by an _screened\ncharge_ $Z_{eff}$.\n\nAs variational wavefunction, we will employ the groundstate of the\nhydrogen atom, which reads:\n\n$$\n\\psi_{var}(r_1, r_2) = e^{-Z_{eff}(r_1+r_2)}\n$$\n\nWe find then that the total energy is:\n$$E_{var}^0 = Z_{eff}^2 -2ZZ_{eff}+\\frac{5}{8}Z_{eff}$$ It becomes\nminimal at\n\n$$\nZ_{eff} = Z- \\frac{5}{16}\n$$\n\nSo at this stage, we might compare the different levels\nof approximation to the experimental result:\n\n- The experimental observation is $E_{exp}^0=-2.90372$ hartree\n\n- The independent particle model predicts $E^0 = -4$ hartree.\n\n- First order pertubation theory predicts $E^0 = -2,709$ hartree.\n\n- The variational principle predicts $E^0 = -2.84$ hartree.\n\nThe best theories achieve an accuracy of $10^{-7}$, see [Hertel 2015,\nChapter 7.2.5](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-54322-7_7).\n\n# Exchange Interaction\n\nUp to now we focused on the ground state properties of the $1^\n1S$ state. In the next step we will try to understand the influence of\nthe interaction term on the excited states (c.f. [Hertel 2015,\nChapter 7](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-54322-7_7)). To attack this problem we will approach it pertubatively.\n\nWe saw that we could factorize the full wavefunction into external and\ninternal degrees of freedom. Further, we have the singlet $\\chi_S$\n(anti-symmetric) and triplet states $\\chi_T$ (symmetric) for the spin.\nThis can now be combined too:\n\n$$\n\\overline{\\psi}_S(1,2) = \\psi_{+}(r_1, r_2)\\chi_S(1,2)\\\\\n\\overline{\\psi}_T(1,2) = \\psi_{-}(r_1, r_2)\\chi_T(1,2)\\\\\n$$\n\nIn a next step, we can construct $\\psi_{\\pm}$ from the eigenstates of\nthe unperturbed Hamiltonian. We define the states\n$\\left|q_1\\right\\rangle \\equiv \\left|n_1,l_1,m_1\\right\\rangle$\nand\n$\\left|q_2\\right\\rangle \\equiv \\left|n_2,l_2,m_2\\right\\rangle$.\nThe properly symmetrized states are:\n\n$$\n\\left|\\psi_\\pm\\right\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left( \\left|q_1\\right\\rangle_1 \\otimes \\left|q_2\\right\\rangle_2 \\pm \\left|q_2\\right\\rangle_1 \\otimes \\left|q_1\\right\\rangle_2 \\right)\n$$\n\nNow we can perform an estimate of the energy shift on\nthese states.\n\n$$\n\\Delta E_{S,T} = \\left\\langle\\overline{\\psi_{S,T} }\\right|\\frac{1}{\\hat{r}_{12}} \\left|\\overline{\\psi_{S,T}}\\right\\rangle\\\\\n= \\left\\langle\\psi_{+,- }\\right|\\frac{1}{\\hat{r}_{12}} \\left|\\psi_{+,- }\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nWe then get\n\n$$\n\\Delta E_{S,T} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\left\\langle q_1 q_2 \\right| \\pm \\left\\langle q_2 q_1\\right|\\right) \\left| \\frac{1}{\\hat{r}_{12}} \\right| \\left( \\left|q_1 q_2\\right\\rangle \\pm \\left|q_2 q_1\\right\\rangle \\right)\\\\\n= \\left\\langle q_1 q_2\\right| \\frac{1}{\\hat{r}_{12}}\\left|q_1 q_2\\right\\rangle \\pm \\left\\langle q_1 q_2\\right| \\frac{1}{\\hat{r}_{12}} \\left|q_2 q_1\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nSo we summarize:\n\n$$\n\\Delta E_S = J_{nl} + K_{nl}\\\\\n\\Delta E_T = J_{nl} - K_{nl}\n$$\n\nThe first term is called _direct_ (Coulomb) term and the second term is\nknown as _exchange_ term.

    "content": "\nIn this lecture we will study the propagation of light through a\ndielectric medium like atomic gases. We will see that it is\ncharacterized by the susceptibility and discuss the case of two-level\natoms. This sets the stage for the laser.\n\nUntil now we focused on the properties of atoms and how can control them\nthrough external fields. In this lecture, we will focus much more on the\nproperties of the light passing through a medium.\n\n## Introduction\n\nWe would like to study the propagation of a electric field through an\nensemble of atoms as visualized in Fig.\n[1](#fig-dielectric). We assume a\nmono-chromatic plane wave to come in, such that we can write down the\nelectric field as:\n\n$$\n\\vec{E}_{in}= E_0 \\vec{\\epsilon}e^{i kz -i\\omega_L t}\n$$\n\nThis incoming field will polarize the gas of dipoles.\n\n<figure id=\"fig-dielectric\">\n<img src=\"./lecture10_pic1.png\" width=\"70%\" />\n<figcaption>Propagation of a light field through a dielectric medium. </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nFor the propagation we will do the following assumptions:\n\n- The atoms are independent.\n- We can describe them as small dipoles.\n- We can describe the light in the semi-classical approximation.\n\nWe have already employed this picture in in the slightly abstract\nformulation in Lecture 4, where we studied the evolution of the atoms in\nelectric fields and in Lecture 6\nconcerning the transition rules in hydrogen. This allows us to calculate\nthe expectation value of the dipole operator through:\n\n$$\n\\langle \\vec{D}\\rangle = \\left\\langle\\psi\\right|\\vec{D}\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nAs already discussed in Lecture 6 we can then write it down as:\n\n$$\n\\langle \\vec{D}\\rangle = E_0 \\vec{\\alpha}\n$$\n\nWe call $\\alpha$ the **polarizability**. For a large gas\nwith a constant density of dipoles $n$, we obtain a macroscopic\npolarization of:\n\n$$\n\\vec{P} = n \\langle \\vec{D}\\rangle\\\\\n= n \\vec{\\alpha} E_0\n$$\n\nThis leads us then to identify the susceptibility of the\ndielectric medium:\n\n$$\n\n\\vec{P} = \\epsilon_0 \\chi \\vec{E}\\\\\n\\chi = \\frac{n \\alpha}{\\epsilon_0}\n$$\n\nTo notes to this relation:\n\n1.  The linear relationship between polarization and electric field is\n    only valid for weak electric fields. For stronger fields, higher\n    order terms become important. They are the fundamental ingredient of\n    non-linear optics. In general, we can write:\n\n$$\n    P_i = \\epsilon_0 \\sum_{j}\\chi_{ij}^{1}E_j+\\epsilon_0 \\sum_{jk}\\chi_{ijk}^{2}E_jE_k + ...\n\n\n\n\n$$\n\n2.  Given that $\\chi$ and $\\alpha$ are proportional to\n    $\\langle D \\rangle$, they can be complex. We will see that real and\n    imaginary part have very different interpretations.\n\n## Propagation of light\n\nAt this stage we would like to understand the propagation of an electric\nfield through such a polarized medium. The general Maxwell equation\nactually reads:\n\n$$\n\n\\nabla^2 \\vec{E}-\\frac{1}{c^2}\\frac{\\partial^2 \\vec{E}}{\\partial t^2}= \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_0 c^2}\\frac{\\partial^2 \\vec{P}}{\\partial t^2}\n$$\n\nThis equation can be massively simplified by only\nlooking at a slowly-evolving envelope $\\mathcal{E}(r,t)$ and\n$\\mathcal{P}(r,t)$, which are defined through:\n\n$$\n\\vec{E} = \\mathcal{E} e^{ikz-i \\omega_L t}\\\\\n\\vec{P} = \\mathcal{P} e^{ikz-i \\omega_L t}\\\\\n$$\n\nAs shown in more detail in [Chapter 4 of Lukin](http://lukin.physics.harvard.edu/wp-uploads/Papers/285b_notes_2005-1.Lily.pdf), the Maxwell equation reduces then to:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\mathcal{E}+\\frac{1}{c}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\mathcal{E} = \\frac{ik}{2\\epsilon_0}\\mathcal{P}\n$$\n\nThis equation becomes especially transparent, if we investigate it for\nvery long times, such that we can perform a Fourier transformation and\nobtain:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\mathcal{E}= i\\frac{\\omega}{c}\\mathcal{E} +\\frac{ik}{2\\epsilon_0}\\mathcal{P}\n$$\n\nFinally, we can use the definition of the susceptibility to write:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\mathcal{E}= i\\left(\\frac{\\omega}{c} +\\frac{k}{2} \\chi(\\omega)\\right) \\mathcal{E}\\\\\n\\mathcal{E}(\\omega, z) =E_0 e^{i\\left(\\frac{\\omega}{c} +\\frac{k}{2}\\chi(\\omega)\\right)z}\n$$\n\n### Absorption and refraction\n\nThe meaning of the susceptibility becomes especially clear for a\ncontinuous wave, where $\\omega\\rightarrow 0$ and we obtain:\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{E}(\\omega\\rightarrow 0, z) =E_0 e^{i\\frac{k\\chi(0)}{2} z}\n$$\n\nWe can then see that:\n\n- The imaginary part of the susceptibility leads to absorption on a\n  scale $l^{-1} = \\frac{k}{2}\\text{Im}(\\chi(0))$\n\n- The real part describes a phase shift. The evolution of the electric\n  field can be seen as propagating with a wavevector\n  $k \\rightarrow k +\\frac{k}{2}\\text{Re}(\\chi(0))$, so the dielectric\n  medium has a refractive index $n = 1 + \\frac{\\text{Re}(\\chi(0))}{2}$\n\n### Dispersion\n\nIf the electric field has a certain frequency distribution, we might\nhave to perform the proper integral to obtain the time evolution, i.e.:\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{E}(t, z) =\\int d\\omega e^{-i\\omega t}\\mathcal{E}(\\omega,0) e^{i\\left(\\frac{\\omega}{c} +\\frac{k}{2}\\chi(\\omega)\\right)z}\n$$\n\nTo solve the problem we can develop the susceptibility:\n\n$$\n\\chi(\\omega) = \\chi(0)+\\frac{d\\chi}{d\\omega}\\omega\n$$\n\nAnd we obtain:\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{E}(t, z) =e^{izk\\chi(0)/2}\n\\mathcal{E}(t-z/v_g, 0)\\\\\nv_g = \\frac{c}{1+\\frac{\\omega_L}{2}\\frac{d\\chi}{d\\omega}}\n$$\n\nSo the group velocity is controlled by the derivative of the\nsusceptibility !\n\n## Two level system\n\nAfter this rather general discussion, we will now employ it to\nunderstand the action of two-level systems on the travelling beam. So we\nwill now focus on the influence of the atoms on the field in comparision\nwith the previous discussions. Further, we will have to take into\naccount the finite lifetime of the excited states in a phenomenological\nmanner. For a two level system with excited state\n$\\left|e\\right\\rangle$ and groundstate\n$\\left|g\\right\\rangle$, we can directly write down the\nwavefunction as:\n\n$$\n\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle = \\gamma_g\\left|g\\right\\rangle+ \\gamma_e\\left|e\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nIn this basis, the dipole element reads:\n\n$$\n\\langle D\\rangle = \\left\\langle e\\right|D\\left|g\\right\\rangle \\gamma_e^*\\gamma_g\\\\\n= d \\sigma_{eg}\n$$\n\nIn the second line we introduced the notations:\n\n- $d = \\left\\langle e\\right|D\\left|g\\right\\rangle$\n\n- The product $\\gamma_e^*\\gamma_g$ can identified with the\n  off-diagonal component of the density operator\n  $\\sigma=\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle\\psi\\right|$.\n  We will often call it **coherence**.\n\nThe Hamiltonian of this model reads then in the rotating\nwave-approximation:\n\n$$\n\\hat{H} = 0\\left|g\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle g\\right|+\\hbar\\delta \\left|e\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle e\\right| + \\hbar\\Omega\\left[\\left|e\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle g\\right|+\\left|g\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle e\\right|\\right]\\\\\n\\Omega = d E/\\hbar\n$$\n\nThis is exactly the model that we discussed in the\nlectures 3 and 4 [@Jendrzejewskib; @Jendrzejewskia]. We then found that\nthe time evolution might be described via:\n\n$$\ni\\dot{\\gamma}_g(t) = \\Omega \\gamma_e\\\\\ni\\dot{\\gamma}_e(t) = \\delta \\gamma_e +\\Omega \\gamma_g\\\\\n$$\n\nWe can combine them to the components of the density\noperator, which then read:\n\n$$\n\\sigma_{ij} = c_{i}^*c_j\n$$\n\nFrom these coefficients, we can now obtain the evolution\nof the populations:\n\n$$\n\\dot{N}_g = \\dot{\\sigma}_{gg} = \\dot{\\gamma}_{g}^*\\gamma_g+ \\gamma_{g}^*\\dot{\\gamma}_g\\\\\n= i\\Omega(\\sigma_{eg}-\\sigma_{ge})\\\\\n\\dot{N}_e = -\\dot{N}_g\n$$\n\nSo the total number of atoms stays automatically\nconserved. As for the coherences we obtain:\n\n$$\n\\dot{\\sigma}_{eg} = \\dot{\\gamma}_{e}^*\\gamma_g+ \\gamma_{e}^*\\dot{\\gamma}_g\\\\\n= i\\delta \\sigma_{eg}+i (N_g-N_e)\\Omega\\\\\n\\dot{\\sigma}_{ge}= -i\\delta \\sigma_{ge}-i (N_g-N_e)\\Omega\n$$\n\nThis density operator approach allows us to introduce spontaneous decay\nin a very straight-forward fashion:\n\n- The time evolution of the excited state gets an additional term\n  $-\\Gamma N_e$.\n\n- Atoms coming from the excited state relax to the ground state, so we\n  add a term $\\Gamma N_e$.\n\n- The coherence decays also through a term $-\\Gamma_2 \\sigma_{ge}$. We\n  will use here for simplicity the limit of $\\Gamma_2 = \\Gamma/2$\n\nSo the full equations read now:\n\n$$\n\\dot{N}_g = i\\Omega(\\sigma_{eg}-\\sigma_{ge})+\\Gamma N_e\\\\\n\\dot{\\sigma}_{ge}= -i\\delta \\sigma_{ge}-i (N_g-N_e)\\Omega-\\Gamma_2\\sigma_{ge}\n$$\n\nAt this stage we can find the steady-state solutions by setting\n$\\dot{N}_g = \\dot{\\sigma}_{ge} = 0$. This leads too:\n\n$$\n\nN_e = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\Omega^2 \\frac{\\Gamma_2}{\\Gamma}}{(\\omega_0-\\omega_L)^2+\\Gamma_2^2+\\Omega^2\\frac{\\Gamma_2}{\\Gamma}}\n$$\n\n$$\n\n\\sigma_{ge} = i\\frac{\\Omega}{2}\\frac{\\Gamma_2-i(\\omega_L-\\omega_0)}{\\Gamma_2^2+(\\omega_0-\\omega_L)^2+\\Omega^2\\Gamma_2/\\Gamma}\n$$\n\nIn the next lecture we will employ those results to\nstudy the laser.",

Most importantly, we saw that electric field can be dephased\nand absorped through the interaction with atomic gases. In this lecture,\nwe will see how this interaction can be employed to induce lasing and\nthen study some basic properties of the laser. In the laser would most\nimportantly find a situation in which the light coming out of the\ndielectric medium is amplified as shown in Fig.\n[1](#fig-laser).\n\n<figure id=\"fig-laser\">\n<img src=\"./lecture11_pic1.png\" width=\"70%\" />\n<figcaption>The Laser set-up.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThe crucial idea of the system is that it is possible to find a\nconfiguration for the medium in which it has a certain gain for the\npropagation of the electric field. So if the light comes into the gain\nmedium with amplitude $I_A$ it exits with amplitude $G^{(0)}I_A$. The\noutput mirror and losses lower the intensity such that the intensity. We\ncan describe losses by the aborption rate $A$. The transmission of the\nsemi-transparent mirror is quantified by the transmission coefficient\n$T$. Putting it all together, the intensity just before reentering the\nmedium reads then $G^{(0)}I_A(1-T)(1-A)$.

Then we will discuss the appropiate configuration for\nlasing and a few properties of the laser.\n\n## The two level system\n\nIn the last lecture, we saw that the two-level system might be described\nby the following rate equations:\n\n$$\n\\dot{N}_g = i\\Omega(\\sigma_{eg}-\\sigma_{ge})+\\Gamma N_e\\\\\n\\dot{\\sigma}_{ge}= -i\\delta \\sigma_{ge}-i (N_g-N_e)\\Omega-\\frac{\\Gamma}{2}\\sigma_{ge}\n$$\n\nThe definitions were:\n\n- $\\Omega$ is the strength of the Rabi coupling.\n\n- $\\delta$ the detuning.\n\n- $\\Gamma$ is the lifetime of the excited state.\n\n- $N_g$ the groundstate population.\n\n- And $\\sigma_{g,e}$ is the coherence\n  $\\sigma_{g,e} = \\gamma_g^* \\gamma_e$.\n\n- $\\Gamma_2$ is the lifetime of the coherence. For the moment we will\n  work in the limit $\\Gamma_2 = \\frac{\\Gamma}{2}$. Let we will relax\n  this point a bit.\n\nAt this stage we can find the steady-state solutions by setting\n$\\dot{N}_g = \\dot{\\sigma}_{ge} = 0$. This leads too:\n\n$$\n\nN_e = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\Omega^2}{2\\delta^2+\\Gamma^2/2+\\Omega^2}\n$$\n\n$$\n\n\\sigma_{ge} = i\\frac{\\Omega}{2}\\frac{\\Gamma-i2\\delta}{2\\delta^2+\\Gamma^2/2+\\Omega^2}\n$$\n\nWe will now discuss these results in the two important regimes of very\nweak and very strong coupling. The first one is important for probe\nexperiments, while the second one is typically the one, where we would\nlike to operate a laser.\n\n### Linear response\n\nFor very small coupling strength we can neglect the $\\Omega$ dependence\nin the coherence and we obtain:\n\n$$\n\\sigma_{ge} = \\frac{\\Omega}{2}\\frac{\\delta+i\\Gamma/2}{\\Gamma^2/4+\\delta^2}\n$$\n\nWe can now plug this into the dipole element [^1]:\n\n$$\nD = d \\sigma_{eg}\\\\\nD = \\frac{d^2}{2}\\frac{\\delta-i\\Gamma/2}{\\Gamma^2/4+\\delta^2}E\n$$\n\nIn the second line, we used the relationship\n$\\Omega = dE$ from lecture 4 [@Jendrzejewskia]. We can then directly\nread of the polarizability and hence the susceptibility, which was\ndefined through $D = \\alpha E$:\n\n$$\n\\alpha =\\frac{d^2}{2}\\frac{\\delta-i\\Gamma/2}{\\Gamma^2/4+\\delta^2}\n$$\n\nOn resonance $\\delta=0$ we have:\n\n$$\n\\alpha(0) =-i\\frac{d^2}{\\Gamma}\\\\\n\\chi(0) = -i\\frac{n}{\\epsilon_0}\\frac{d^2}{\\Gamma}\n$$\n\nWe obtain now rather directly that:\n\n- Absorption is maximal on resonance.\n\n- There is no dephasing on resonance.\n\n- For large detunings the absorption can be increasingly neglected and\n  the media becomes refractive as it only keeps an optical index.\n\nWe can then also look for maximum dephasing and find the it happens\nclose to the resonance. A summary can be found in Fig.\n[2](#fig-susc).\n\n<figure id=\"fig-susc\">\n<img src=\"./lecture11_pic2.png\" width=\"70%\" />\n<figcaption>Susceptibility of the two level system.

To simplify the discussion let\nus rewrite the eq. the populations and coherence of the two-level system on resonance:\n\n$$\nN_e = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\Omega^2}{\\Gamma^2/2+\\Omega^2}\\\\\n\\sigma_{ge} = i\\frac{\\Omega}{2}\\frac{\\Gamma}{\\Gamma^2/2+\\Omega^2}\n$$\n\nWe can see that the excited fraction is limited to $1/2$\nof the atoms. So at some point the system cannot react anymore to the\nadditional coupling strength. This is also the reason for the decay of\nthe coherence at very large $\\Omega$, which is basically telling us that\nthe medium becomes transparent. This kind of observations motivates for\npractical purposes to introduce the saturation intensity\n$I_{sat} \\propto \\frac{\\Gamma^2}{2}$, which allows us to rewrite the\nprevious to equations as:\n\n$$\nN_e = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{I/I_{sat}}{1+I/I_{sat}}\n$$\n\nFinally, this kind of expressions allows us also nicely to see the\ndirect connection between the dipole element and the number of excited\natoms:\n\n$$\n\\sigma_{ge} = i\\frac{N_e}{\\Omega}\n$$\n\nSo we never obtain a situation, where the two-level\nsystem amplifies light. Let us look into this situation once again from\na technical point of view to see if we can obtain situations of\namplificiation.\n\n## Rate equations\n\nTo understand laser it is best to formulate the interaction of atoms and\nlight in terms of rate equations for the populations, assuming that the\ncoherences follow adiabatically. While strict derivations can become\nvery tedious, they can be written down in a phenomenological way rather\neasily. So we will convince us here in some limiting cases of the\nusefulness.\n\nWe now would like to use the previous discussions to set up the\nnecessary formalism for laser amplification, which is based on the idea\nof rate equations. While these equations are of phenomenological nature,\nwe can convince ourselves of their soundness in a first step.\n\n### The two-level system\n\nIn the last lecture we saw that we can write down the following Bloch\nequations for the two-level system on resonance:\n\n$$\n\\dot{N}_g = -i\\Omega(\\sigma_{eg}-\\sigma_{ge})+\\Gamma N_e\\\\\n\\dot{\\sigma}_{ge}= i (N_g-N_e)\\Omega-\\Gamma_2\\sigma_{ge}\n$$\n\nIn a substantial amount of situations the coherences\nreach the steady state much faster than the population. This can be due\nto technical noise, collisions or other effects. In this case we can\nassume $\\dot{\\sigma}_{ge}=0$ and the solve for the populations:\n\n$$\n\\sigma_{ge}= i \\frac{\\Omega}{\\Gamma_2} (N_g-N_e)\\\\\n\\sigma_{eg}-\\sigma_{ge} = -2i \\frac{\\Omega}{\\Gamma_2} (N_g-N_e)\n$$\n\nWe can see in this limit that the inversion of the sign\nof the dipole element would come with $N_g < N_e$ **in the\nsteady-state**. We saw previously that we cannot achieve this limit in\nthe two-level system.\n\nHaving eliminated adiabatically the coherences, we end up with the\nfollowing time evolution of the population:\n\n$$\n\\dot{N}_g = 2\\frac{\\Omega^2}{\\Gamma_2}(N_e-N_g)+\\Gamma N_e\\\\\n$$\n\nWe can now identify the three terms as:\n\n- Stimulated emission.\n\n- Stimulated absorption.\n\n- Spontaneous emission.\n\nWe will then focus on the rate equation for the populations and attempt\nto find situations, where $N_g < N_e$.\n\n### Optional: Rate equations for light\n\nTo see, when light amplification will happen, we now need to connect the\nrate equations to evolution of light within the medium. One heuristic\napproach is guided by the Beer-Lambert law (Ch. 4.2.3 of [Hertel 2015](https://doi.org/10.1007%2F978-3-642-54322-7)\n).\n\n$$\n\\frac{dI}{dz}=- N_g\\sigma I\n$$\n\nWe would like to translate this now more precisely into\na change of photon numbers through the relation:\n\n$$\nI = c \\hbar\\omega N_{ph}\n$$\n\nThis allows us to rewrite for a propagation wave with\n$z = ct$:\n\n$$\n- \\frac{N_g\\sigma I}{\\hbar \\omega} = \\frac{d}{dt}N_{ph} = \\frac{dN_g}{dt} = -\\frac{dN_e}{dt}\n$$\n\nThis allows us to define an absorption rate:\n\n$$\nR_{ab} =  \\frac{\\sigma I}{\\hbar \\omega}\\\\\n= \\frac{1}{N_g}\\frac{dN_g}{dt}\n$$\n\nThis process is just the description of **stimulated\nabsorption**. Nothing was special about the discussion of the absorption\nand we can actually also have exactly the inverse situation, where we\nassume that all the atoms start out in the excited state and then lead\nto an increased intensity:\n\n$$\n\\frac{dI}{dz}= N_e\\sigma I\n$$\n\nBoth processes are now computing and we obtain in\ngeneral:\n\n$$\n\\frac{dI}{dz}= (N_e-N_g)\\sigma I\n$$\n\nSo if we have most atoms in the excited state and neglect the atoms in\nthe ground state we can actually have light amplification. This is idea\nis underlying the laser. However, we have already seen for the two-level\nsystem that this situation is not easily achieved and we will now\ndiscuss it a bit further.\n\n## Lasing condition in a four-level system\n\nTo obtain in the medium, it is necessary to have an excited state\npopulation which is higher than the population of the ground state. This\nis not possible in the two-level system and in practice realized mostly\nin four-level systems.\n\n<figure id=\"fig-4level\">\n<img src=\"./lecture11_pic3.png\" width=\"70%\" />\n<figcaption>The 4 level system.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThe idea of such a system is the following:\n\n- A strong pumping beam excites atoms into the state $e$.\n\n- From $e$ they decay rapidely into the state b. This is the upper\n  state for the lasing transition $b\\rightarrow a$.\n\n- We obtain lasing on the transition $b\\rightarrow a$, which has a\n  decay rate of $\\tau_B$\n\n- The lower state $a$ is easily depopulated through the fast\n  relaxation $a\\rightarrow g$.\n\nWe can now write down the rate equations for a weak laser, such that we\ncan only keep terms in first order:\n\n$$\n\\dot{N}_e = w(N_g-N_e)-N_e/\\tau_e\\\\\n\\dot{N}_b = \\frac{N_e}{\\tau_e}-N_b/\\tau_b\\\\\n\\dot{N}_a = \\frac{N_b}{\\tau_b}-N_a/\\tau_a\\\\\n\\dot{N}_g = \\frac{N_a}{\\tau_a}-w(N_g-N_e)\n$$\n\nWe can now find steady state solutions assuming that\n$\\tau_e, \\tau_a \\ll \\tau_b$. Further we assume that the pumping to $e$\nis not too strong, i.e. $w \\tau_e\\ll1$. We then obtain:\n\n$$\nN_e \\simeq w\\tau_e N_g\\\\\nN_b \\simeq w\\tau_b N_g\\\\\nN_a \\simeq w\\tau_a N_g\n$$\n\nWe then obtain the state populations:\n\n$$\n\\frac{N_b-N_a}{N_g + N_e + N_a + N_b}\\simeq \\frac{w\\tau_b}{1+w\\tau_b}\n$$\n\nLasing is then obtained above the pumping threshold at which the gain\novercomes the losses.\n\n## Steady-state operation of the laser\n\nAssuming that the lasing condition is fullfilled, we can now investigate\nits steady-state behavior. Quite importantly, we have to have an\nelectric field, which remains exactly constant after each round\ntrip.This implies to conditions:\n\n- The gain has to cancel the losses:\n\n$$\n    G = \\frac{1}{(1-T)(1-A)}\n\n\n\n\n$$\n\n- The phase after the round trip has to be a multiple of $2\\pi$\n\nFor a cavity of length $L$, the wavelength $\\lambda_p$ has to be an\ninteger fraction:\n\n$$\nL_{cav} = p\\lambda_p\\text{ with }p \\in  \\mathbb{N}\\\\\n\\omega_p/2\\pi =p \\frac{c}{L}\n$$\n\nSo the lasing will not happen at one single frequency,\nbut actually for any wavelength fulfilling this condition. The laser has\nmultiple **longitudinal modes**. Some tricks allow to suppress this\nmulti-mode behavior, such that we obtain a very pure light source.\n\n<figure id=\"fig-freq-laser\">\n<img src=\"./lecture11_pic4.png\" width=\"70%\" />\n<figcaption>Frequency distribution of the steady-state laser.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n## Mode-locked operation\n\nWe have seen in the last section that a laser might act in the multimode\nregime. So let us write down for simplicity the total field, where we\nassume that the relative phase between modes in uncorrelated and that\nthe amplitude is the same for all of them. We then have:\n\n$$\nE(t) = \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}E_0 \\cos(\\omega_k t +\\phi_k)\n$$\n\nThe frequency of each mode:\n\n$$\n\\omega_k = \\omega_0 + k \\Delta\\text{ with }\\Delta/2\\pi = \\frac{c}{L_{cav}}\n$$\n\nSumming the electric fields leads to an intensity:\n\n$$\nI(t)= \\frac{NE_0^2}{2}+E_0^2\\sum_{j_k}\\cos\\left[(\\omega_j-\\omega_k)t+\\phi_j-\\phi_k\\right]\n$$\n\nFor uncorrelated fields this intensity is on average\n$\\overline{I} = \\frac{NE_0^2}{2}$ with temporal fluctuations in the\norder of the amplitude itself [^2] For correlated fields the equations\nsimplify a lot and we obtain:\n\n$$\nI = \\frac{1}{2}\\left|\\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}E_0e^{-i\\omega_k t}\\right|^2\\\\\n = \\frac{E_0^2}{2}\\left|\\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}e^{i k\\Delta  t}\\right|^2\\\\\n = \\frac{E_0^2}{2}\\left|\\frac{\\sin(\\frac{N\\Delta t}{2})}{\\sin(\\frac{\\Delta t}{2})}\\right|^2\n$$\n\nThe maximum intensity in this coherent sum is now\n\n$$\nI_{max} = N\\overline{I}\n$$\n\nWe can then reach petawatt (!!) peak powers.\n\nIn the next lecture, we will study how the laser is actually used for the study of entanglement\n\n[^1]:\n    The sign change appears as we are now working with $\\sigma_{eg}$\n    instead of $\\sigma_{ge}$\n\n[^2]: We obtain actually a speckle pattern in time here.",

    "content": "\nWe will discuss the creation of entangled photons and how they can be\nused for the test of Bell's inequalities.\n\nWe have previously discussed how complicated gain media allow for the\namplification light. Here we will discuss how it is\nused to create entangled photons and then dive into the fundamental test\nof the Bell inequalities.\n\n# Parametric down-conversion\n\n<figure id=\"fig-downcon\">\n<img src=\"./lecture12_pic1.png\" width=\"70%\" />\n<figcaption>a) The process of spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC).\nInside a nonlinear crystal, two outgoing photons are created from an\nincoming photon. Momentum and energy conservation apply, resulting in a\ncharacteristic emission cone. b) Two photons created by SPDC encounter\npolarizers. Depending on the polarization, the photons are either\nabsorbed or transmitted. After passing the polarizers, the photons are\ncollected with two optical fibers and detected with single photon\ncounters. The detector indicates a coincidence when both photons arrive\nwithin roughly 30 ns.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nFig. [1](#fig-downcon) shows the\nschematic setup of an experiment where pairs of entangled photons are\ncreated by a two-photon source. Two polarizers can be used to probe the\npolarization of the photons.\n\n## Three-wave mixing\n\nThe crystal in the medium is a non-linear crystal, which means that we\ncan write the polarization is not just linear, but higher order terms\nwill play a role. We will consider for starters that there are actually\ntwo pump waves in the same direction, which allows us to write:\n\n$$\nP_{NL}(z) = 2\\epsilon_0 \\chi^{(2)}\\mathcal{E}_1(z)\\mathcal{E}_2(z)e^{i(k_1+k_2)z}\n$$\n\nThis non-linear polarizability leads to the following\nequations of motion [@grynberg]:\n\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mathcal{E}_3}{dz}e^{ik_3 z} = \\frac{i\\omega_3}{2\\epsilon_0n_3c}P_{NL}(z) \\\\\n \\frac{d\\mathcal{E}_3}{dz}= \\frac{i\\omega_3}{n_3c}\\chi^{(2)}\\mathcal{E}_1(z)\\mathcal{E}_2(z)e^{i(k_1+k_2-k_3)z} \\\\,\n$$\n\nwhere $\\omega_3 = \\omega_1 + \\omega_2$. We can now\nadditionally assume that:\n\n- The effect of the medium does not change the strong pump to much.\n\n- The amplified field is zero initially.\n\n- The oscillating phase factor $(k_1+k_2-k_3)z$ can be ignored, i.e.\n  where we have:\n\n$$\n    \\vec{k}_3 = \\vec{k}_1 + \\vec{k}_2\n\n\n\n\n$$\n\nWe can then simplify to:\n\n$$\n \\frac{d\\mathcal{E}_3}{dz}=\\frac{i\\omega_3 \\chi^{(2)}}{n_3c}\\mathcal{E}_1\\mathcal{E}_2\n$$\n\nSo the amplitude of the mixed field increases in a\nlinear fashion in the non-linear medium. However, the typical amplitude\nfor production is below 1% for commonly used crystals.\n\n# Polarization entangled photons\n\nWe will try to observe correlations between the photons. Two optical\nfibers are collecting the pairs of photons and transmit them to the\nsingle photon detectors. Finite collection and detection efficiency\ncauses only one of the two photons to be detected in most cases.\nTherefore, a coincidence circuit registers events in which two photons\narrive within 30 ns. As the rate of detected individual photons is about\n50 kHz, we assume that photons arriving during such a small time window\nwere created in the same event.\n\n## Polarization analysis\n\nTo study the quantum nature of the correlations, we will employ\npolarizers and later dive into Bell's inequalities as well as\nentanglement in general. The interested reader will have a great time\nreading through the complement 5.C of [Grynberg](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/introduction-to-quantum-optics/F45DCE785DC8226D4156EC15CAD5FA9A).\n\nThe first emitted photon is analyzed by a rotatable polarizers\n$\\hat{A}(\\theta)$, which has two detection paths $\\pm1$. The other\npolarizer will be called $\\hat{B}(\\theta)$ the only difference is that\nhe only acts on photon 2. Basically, we are following the _Alice_ and\n_Bob_ notation here.\n\nWe can express it then in our basis states of vertical polarization\n$\\left|V\\right\\rangle$ and horizontal polarization\n$\\left|H\\right\\rangle$. The polarizer aligned with $H$ has\neigenvalues:\n\n$$\n\\hat{A} \\left|H\\right\\rangle= +\\left|H\\right\\rangle\\\\\n\\hat{A} \\left|V\\right\\rangle= -\\left|V\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nTo analyse the polarization of each photon in detail we can also rotate\nthe polarizer by an angle of $\\theta$. In this case the transmitted\neigenstates are:\n\n$$\n\\left|\\theta\\right\\rangle_{+} = \\cos(\\theta)\\left|H\\right\\rangle +\\sin(\\theta)\\left|V\\right\\rangle\\\\\n\\left|\\theta\\right\\rangle_{-} = -\\sin(\\theta)\\left|H\\right\\rangle +\\cos(\\theta)\\left|V\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nTaking as input states\n$\\left|H\\right\\rangle$, we simply find Malus law:\n\n$$\nP_+(\\theta) = \\cos(\\theta)^2\\\\\nP_-(\\theta) = \\sin(\\theta)^2\\\\\n$$\n\nIn the rotated basis we can express the polarization\noperator as:\n\n$$\n\\hat{A}(\\theta) = \\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\cos(2\\theta)& \\sin(2\\theta)\\\\\n\\sin(2\\theta)& -\\cos(2\\theta)\n\\end{array}\\right)\n$$\n\nWe can now employ the two polarizers to investigate the\ntwo emitted photons as shown in Fig. [2](#fig-polar-anal).\n\n<figure id=\"fig-polar-anal\">\n<img src=\"./lecture12_pic2.png\" width=\"90%\" />\n<figcaption>Polarization analysis of correlated photons</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThe possible outcome of our experiments are the four states\n$\\{HH, HV, VH, VV\\}$ and hence we could decompose our full wavefunction\nas:\n\n$$\n\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle = c_0 \\left|HH\\right\\rangle+ c_1 \\left|HV\\right\\rangle + c_2 \\left|VH\\right\\rangle + c_3\\left|VV\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nUsing the two polarizers we can now start to investigate\nthe prefactors of the full wavefunction. Let us first look into the\nresults of a polarizer that is not rotated. We find:\n\n$$\n\\left\\langle\\psi\\right|\\hat{A}\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle=|c_0|^2 + |c_1|^2 - |c_2|^2-|c_3|^2\n$$\n\nFor Bobs polarizer in the same position we would find:\n\n$$\n\\left\\langle\\psi\\right|\\hat{B}\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle=|c_0|^2+ |c_2|^2 - |c_1|^2 -|c_3|^2\n$$\n\n## An equivalent 2 qubit circuit\n\nThe optics setup handles two independent photons, with two outcomes\neach. So we can also see the presented setup as a two qubit system. A\ncircuit diagram would mostly look the following way.\n\n<figure id=\"fig-two-qubit\">\n<img src=\"./lecture12_pic3.png\" width=\"90%\" />\n<figcaption>Realizing the two-photon experiment within a quantum circuit. What are\nthe correlations the two photons have ?</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThe two photons originate from an unknown source, which is here modelled\nby photons propagating through some unitary matrix $\\hat{U}$. The\nmeasurement is performed in the last step, projecting the qubit on its\nup or down state. The rotation around the x axis $\\hat{R}_x$ transforms\na qubit state into a superposition. In strong analogy to the\npolarization\n\n## A naive guess\n\nWe know that we have two photons in the system. Both can have some\npolarization and clearly they are propagation in different directions.\nSo it does not seems to much of a stretch to guess that the total\nwavefunction is the product of two superposition states:\n\n$$\n\n\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle_{p} = (c_{H,1}\\left|H\\right\\rangle +c_{V,1} \\left|V\\right\\rangle)\\otimes(c_{H,2}\\left|H\\right\\rangle+c_{V,2}\\left|V\\right\\rangle) \\\\\n= (c_{H,1}c_{H,2}\\left|HH\\right\\rangle + c_{V,1}c_{V,2}\\left|VV\\right\\rangle + c_{V,1}c_{H,2}\\left|VH\\right\\rangle + c_{H,1}c_{V,2}\\left|HV\\right\\rangle)\n$$\n\n## The experimental observation of entanglement\n\n- We find a lot of counts if both polarizers are set vertical or\n  horizontal. So the state has a $VV$ and a $HH$ component, which\n  tells us that $c_0$ and $c_{3}$ are non-zero. The equal rate of\n  measuring further tells us that they are roughly similiar in\n  amplitude, so we can write for simplicity $|c_0| = |c_3|$\n\n- We find zero correlation if the polarizers are opposite. So the\n  mixed terms are zero $c_1 = c_2 = 0$\n\nIn summary we can expect the Bell state can to be written as:\n\n$$\n\\left|\\psi_B\\right\\rangle = \\frac{\\left|HH\\right\\rangle +\\left|VV\\right\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}\n$$\n\nThis is quite clearly incompatible with our naive guess, which means that we have an entangled state.\n\n# Optional: Quantifying entanglement\n\nWe will study the properties of the entangled states later in more\ndetail. However, we will take a short moment to cite two ways of\nquanitfying the entanglement through the density operator:\n\n$$\n\\hat{\\rho} = \\sum_i \\eta_i \\left|i\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle i\\right|\n$$\n\nThe reduced density operator, which shows mixed states if there is\nentanglement:\n\n$$\n    \\hat{\\rho}_1 = \\mathrm{tr}_{2}(\\hat{\\rho})\n$$\n\nIn this case, $\\hat{\\rho}$ is the density operator\nof a pure state and $\\textrm{tr}_2$ is the trace over the Hilbert\nspace of particle 2.\n\nThe von Neumann entropy, which measures the remaining uncertainty\nwithin a quantum state:\n\n$$\n    S=-\\mathrm{tr}(\\hat{\\rho}\\ln\\hat{\\rho})\\\\\n     = - \\sum_i \\eta_i \\ln \\eta_i = \\sum_i \\eta_i \\ln \\frac{1}{\\eta_i}\n$$\n\nFor the Bell states of we find then:\n\n$$\n\\hat{\\rho_B}_1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\left|H\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle H\\right| + \\left|V\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle V\\right| \\right)\n$$\n\nIts corresponding entropy is $S=\\ln 2$, the entropy of a\npure state is $S=0$.\n\n# Back to the correlation between distant photons\n\nIn the last sections we performed measurements on joined detection\nprobabilities between two independent polarizers. Quite importantly we\nsaw that:\n\n- Each photon is in a superposition of\n  $\\left|H\\right\\rangle$ and\n  $\\left|V\\right\\rangle$.\n\n- Both photons are always detected in the same polarization state.\n\n- From Fig. [2](#fig-polar-anal) it\n  seems as if 1 was a bit closer to the source than 2 [^1]. So 1 is\n  detected a bit earlier and projected onto one of the two states.\n\n- Yet, 2 seems to instantaneously on which polarization 1 was\n  projected and choses the same one.\n\nFor our set-up the distances are small, but the same observations and\narguments hold also for very large distances between the detectors.\nEinstein, Podolski and Rosen understood this long distance correlation\nand decided that something was funky about quantum mechanics\n[@Einstein_1935].\n\nTherefore, the idea of an additional hidden shared parameter can be\nintroduced to explain the correlations between distant objects. We will\nsimply assume that the two photons have well-defined polarization with\nangle $\\lambda$ from the starting point, yet this polarization varies\nrandomly from pair to pair between 0 and $2\\pi$. Hence we have uniform\nprobability distribution $\\rho(\\lambda) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}$. The\nmeasurement of the polarizers can then simply be modelled through\n\n$$\nA_{hv}(\\lambda, \\theta) =\\text{sign}\\left(\\cos2 (\\theta-\\lambda)\\right)\n$$\n\nThis model reproduces nicely all the tests that we ran\npreviously. Namely, maximum detection for HH and VV as well as zero\ncorrelation for $HV$. They can be nicely compared through the\ncorrelation coefficient $E(\\theta_1,\\theta_2)$. The particularly\nperturbing case is that this simple model for hidden parameters works\neven perfectly well in the case of $45^\\circ$ angles. So is there any\nmeasurable difference between our observations and the hidden variable\nmodels ?\n\n<figure id=\"fig-corr\">\n<img src=\"./lecture12_pic4.png\" width=\"70%\" />\n<figcaption>Correlation coefficient as taken from¬† <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/introduction-to-quantum-optics/F45DCE785DC8226D4156EC15CAD5FA9A\">Grynberg</a>.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n# Bell's theorem\n\nBell posed the previous discussion on a more general and quite simple\nfooting [Bell 1964](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/physicsphysiquefizika.1.195) and later extended by [Clauser, Horner, Shimony, Holt](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/physrevlett.23.880). For the hidden parameter we need just a standard\ndensity distribution with:\n\n$$\n\\rho(\\lambda)\\geq 0\\\\\n\\int d\\lambda \\rho(\\lambda) = 1\n$$\n\nWe additionally should describe the polarizer by some function that\ntakes the value $\\pm 1$ depending on the angle of the polarizer and the\nhidden variable:\n\n$$\n|A(\\lambda, \\theta_1) |= |A(\\lambda, \\theta_2) | =1\n$$\n\nIn the experiment we now have two polarizers $A$ for\nAlice and $B$ for Bob, which we will allow to be in some position\n$\\theta$ as visualized in Fig. [5](#fig-bell).\n\n<figure id=\"fig-bell\">\n<img src=\"./lecture12_pic5.png\" width=\"70%\" />\n<figcaption>A Bell experiment.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nWe will now calculate the the expectation value for joint detection:\n\n$$\nE(\\theta_1, \\theta_2)=\\overline{A(\\theta_1)B(\\theta_2)}-\\overline{A(\\theta_1)}~\\overline{B(\\theta_2)}\n$$\n\nWe can simplify further for equal probability of having\nH or V polarization, which leads too:\n\n$$\nE(\\theta_1, \\theta_2)=\\overline{A(\\theta_1)B(\\theta_2)}\\\\\n =\\int d\\lambda  A(\\lambda, \\theta_1)B(\\lambda, \\theta_2)\n$$\n\nBells inequalities are then studying the correlations\nbetween photons in four different configuations:\n\n$$\ns(\\lambda, \\theta_1, \\theta_1', \\theta_2, \\theta_2')= A(\\lambda, \\theta_1)B(\\lambda, \\theta_2)-A(\\lambda, \\theta_1)B(\\lambda, \\theta_2') +A(\\lambda, \\theta_1')B(\\lambda, \\theta_2)+A(\\lambda, \\theta_1')B(\\lambda, \\theta_2')\\\\\n= A(\\lambda, \\theta_1)(B(\\lambda, \\theta_2)-B(\\lambda, \\theta_2'))+A(\\lambda, \\theta_1')(B(\\lambda, \\theta_2)+B(\\lambda, \\theta_2'))\\\\\n= \\pm 2\n$$\n\nWe actually have no access to the hidden parameter, so\nwe are looking for its average value:\n\n$$\nS = \\int d\\lambda \\rho(\\lambda) s(\\lambda, \\theta_1, \\theta_1', \\theta_2, \\theta_2')\\\\\n-2\\leq S\\leq 2\n$$\n\nAnd this value can now be measured experimentally as we\ncan identify:\n\n$$\nS = E(\\theta_1, \\theta_2)-E(\\theta_1, \\theta_2')+E(\\theta_1', \\theta_2)+E(\\theta_1', \\theta_2')\n$$\n\nThis is known as the Bell--Clauser--Horn--Shimony--Holt\n(CHSH) inequalities.\n\n## The inconsistency between hidden parameters and quantum mechanics\n\nWe can now go again through the predictions of quantum mechanics and\ntest if there is a region of interest in which we should observe a\nviolation of the CHSH inequalities. Actually there is an important\nconfiguration at which we should break them rather violantly namely for:\n\n$$\n|\\theta_1-\\theta_2| =\\frac{\\pi}{8}(22.5^\\circ)\\\\\n|\\theta_1'-\\theta_2| =\\frac{\\pi}{8}(22.5^\\circ)\\\\\n|\\theta_1'-\\theta_2'| =\\frac{\\pi}{8}(22.5^\\circ)\\\\\n|\\theta_1-\\theta_2'| =\\frac{3\\pi}{8}(67.5^\\circ)\\\\\n$$\n\nHere, we expect to have $S= 2\\sqrt{2}$. So to test Bells\ninequalities we have to measure the joint probabilities in rather\nunusual angles. This also explains why quantum mechanics and local\nhidden variables seem so similiar in this kind of experiments, the\nbiggest differences are hard to see accidentally.\n\n## The experimental test\n\nWe can now study the correlations for the following configuration.\n\n$$\n\\theta_1 = 0 \\text{ and }\\theta_1' = \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\\\\n\\theta_2 = \\frac{\\pi}{8} \\text{ and }\\theta_2' = \\frac{3\\pi}{8}\\\\\n$$\n\n<figure id=\"fig-measure\">\n<img src=\"./lecture12_pic5.png\" width=\"70%\" />\n<figcaption>Correlation measurements.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nIn the figure above we present correlation measurement between the two photons measured with the\nsetup shown in the second figure.

If we now want\nto leave these rather academic problems and turn to the other widely\nused atoms, molecules etc, we have towards effective models for two\nreasons:\n\n- Analytical solutions do not exist.\n\n- Full numerical solutions become extremely and expansive.\n\nA particularly instructive discussion of the ineffeciency of brute force\nnumerical methods was given by Kenneth Wilson, the father of the\nrenormalization group, in Sec 3 of [Wilson 1975](<http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0001-8708(75)90149-8>).\n\n<figure id=\"fig-toy\">\n<img src=\"./lecture13_pic1.png\" width=\"70%\" />\n<figcaption>A toy model, exemplifying the problem of direct numerical analysis.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThe main idea is plotted in Fig. [1](#fig-toy) and its description in the words of Kenny Wilson can\nbe found in Fig. [2](#fig-ineff).\n\n<figure id=\"fig-ineff\">\n<img src=\"./lecture13_pic2.png\" width=\"95%\" />\n<figcaption>On the inefficiency of brute force numerics.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nWe will come back to different experimental approaches to solve problems\nfor which we cannot devise effective theories at a later stage, when we\ndiscuss quantum simulation and quantum computation with atomic systems.\nBut first we will try to gain a good understanding of atoms with many\nelectrons.\n\n# Atoms with Many Electrons\n\nAs already discussed before, the N electron system cannot be solved in\nits full complexity, so we have to walk through the different levels of\nphysical effects to understand what is going on. We will start out with\nthe simplest model, which consists of\n\n- N electrons without spin\n\n- Bound to the point-like nucleus of charge $Z$, which is supposed to\n  be not moving.\n\nIn natural units, the Hamiltonian can be written as:\n\n$$\n\\hat{H} = \\sum_i^N \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} \\vec{\\nabla}^2_{r_i} - \\frac{Z}{r_i} \\right) + \\sum_{i<j} \\frac{1}{r_{ij}}.\n$$\n\nThe system is visualized in Fig.\n[3](#fig-three-ele).\n\n<figure id=\"fig-three-ele\">\n<img src=\"./lecture13_pic3.png\" width=\"70%\" />\n<figcaption>Charge distribution of three electrons bound to the nucleus.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nAs before the Hamiltonian has two contributions:\n\n- The well understood binding of each electron to the nucleus, which\n  allows us to make the connection with the hydrogen orbitals.\n\n- The interaction between the electrons, which couples all the\n  orbitals.\n\nHow can we deal with the $1/r_{ij}$ terms? If many electrons are\ncontained in the system we cannot ignore the influence of the\nelectron-electron interaction on the system, which was already a\nquestionable approximation in the Helium atom.\n\n# Central Field Approximation\n\nBut we can bring back the system to the well-known problems with\nspherical symmetry by splitting the interaction into two parts. One will\nbe assumed to have spherical symmetry and will be written as\n$\\sum_i S(r_i)$ and the rest will be treated as a perturbation. So we\nobtain the Hamiltonian:\n\n$$\n\\hat{H} = \\hat{H}_s + \\hat{H}_1\\\\\n\\hat{H}_s = \\sum_i^N \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} \\vec{\\nabla}^2_{r_i} + V_\\textrm{cf}(r_i) \\right)\\\\\nV_\\textrm{cf} (r_i) = - \\frac{Z}{r_i} + S(r_i),\n$$\n\nThe perturbation is then difference between the\nspherically symmetric part of the interaction and the true\nelectron-electron interaction:\n\n$$\n\\hat{H}_1 = \\sum_{i<j} \\frac{1}{r_{ij}} - \\sum_i S(r_i)\n$$\n\n$S(r_i)$ describes now the screening of the nucleus due\nto the other electrons. This function interpolates between (see\n[4](#fig-screening)):\n\n$$\nV_\\textrm{cf} (\\vec{r}_i) = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ccc} -\\frac{Z}{r_i} &\\text{for}& r\\to 0 \\\\ \\\\ -\\frac{Z-N+1}{r_i} & \\text{for} & r\\to\\infty  \\end{array} \\right.\n$$\n\n- For very small distances the electron mainly sees the strong\n  attraction of the nucleus.\n\n- For very large distances the other electrons mostly screen the\n  charge of the nucleus and electron feels the $1/r$ potential of the\n  hydrogen atom.\n\n<figure id=\"fig-screening\">\n<img src=\"./lecture13_pic4.png\" width=\"70%\" />\n<figcaption>The screening as a function of distance.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nWe can now focus on the study of the part with spherical symmetry\n$\\hat{H}_s$. Given its symmetry, we can once again use the conservation\nof orbital angular momentum (see Lecture 5). As a\nresult, the wave function can be a product state of single-particle wave\nfunctions:\n\n$$\n\\psi_\\textrm{cf} (\\vec{r}_1 , \\cdots , \\vec{r}_\\textrm{n} ) = \\psi_1 (\\vec{r}_1) \\cdot \\psi_2(\\vec{r}_2) \\cdot \\cdots \\psi_\\textrm{n}(\\vec{r}_\\textrm{n}),\n$$\n\nwhere $\\psi_i(\\vec{r}_i)$ are solutions of the\nSchr√∂dinger equation:\n\n$$\n\\left( - \\frac{1}{2} \\vec{\\nabla}^2_{\\vec{r}_i} + V_\\textrm{cf} (r_i) \\right) \\psi_i (\\vec{r}_i) = E_i \\psi_i(\\vec{r}_i).\n$$\n\n$\\psi_i$ can be split up into a radial and an angular\npart:\n\n$$\n\\psi_i = \\psi(nlm)_i = Y_{lm} (\\theta, \\varphi) \\cdot R_{nl} (r).\n$$\n\nFor the radial part we get $u(r) = r\\cdot R(r)$. Thus,\n$u(r)$ solves the radial Schr√∂dinger equation:\n\n$$\n\\left( - \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{d^2}{dr^2} + V_\\textrm{cf}(r) + \\frac{l(l+1)}{2r^2}\\right) u_{nl} = E_{nl} u_{nl} (r).\n$$\n\nThe major difference to the $\\mathrm{H}$ atom is that\nthe degeneracy of the $l$ levels is lifted because of $V_\\textrm{cf}$.\n\n## On the determination of the effective potential\n\nWe will not discuss here the different techniques to derive the central\nfield in detail as this is quickly diving into the different numerical\ntechniques of many-body systems. A first discussion of the different\napproaches can be found in chapter 10 of [Hertel 2015](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-54322-7_10). The different\nlevels of sophistication are:\n\n- The _Thomas-Fermi_ model, which assumes that the $N$ electrons\n  behave like a Fermi gas inside the $Z/r$ potential.\n\n- The Hartree method, in which the effective potential is iteratively\n  recalculated based on the obtained solutions to the radial\n  Schr√∂dinger equation.\n\n- The Hartree Fock method, in which we also take into account the\n  proper symmetrization of the wavefunctions.\n\n# Filling up the shells\n\nIf we can ignore the spin for the determination of the energy levels, we\nhave the following quantum numbers:\n\n- $n$, which is electron shell.\n\n- $l$, which is the orbital angular momentum with $l<n$.\n\n- $s$, which is the spin of the electron and it can be $\\pm 1/2$\n\nAs the electrons are fermions we can fill up each of the $nl$ states\nwith two of them. We then write down the configuration of the electron\nby writing down the numbers of electrons per $nl$ configuration. So we\nget the periodic table shown in Fig. [5](#783282){reference-type=\"ref\"\nreference=\"783282\"}. We will typically use the following notation:\n\n- A _configuration_ is the distribution of the electrons over the\n  different orbits.\n\n- Electrons with the same $n$ are part of the same _shell_.\n\n- Electrons with the same $n$ and $l$ are part of the same\n  _sub-shell_.\n\n- The inner shells are typically filled and form the _core_.\n\n- The outermost shell is typically named the _valence_ shell.\n\n<figure id=\"fig-measure\">\n<img src=\"./lecture13_pic5.png\" width=\"70%\" />\n<figcaption>Periodic table as taken from <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Detailiertes_Periodensystem_mit_Elektronenkonfiguration.png\">wiki commons</a> </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n# Alkali Atoms\n\nAlkali atoms are the simplest to understand and widely used in the field\nof laser cooling. The electron configurations are\n\n#### Examples.\n\n- $\\mathrm{Li}$: 1s$^2$ 2s\n\n- $\\mathrm{Na}$:\n  1s$^2$ 2s$^2$ 2p$^6$ 3s\n\n- $\\mathrm{K}$:\n  1s$^2$ 2s$^2$ 2p$^6$ 3s$^2$ 3p$^6$ 4s,\n  so we fill up the 4s orbitals before the 3d orbitals.\n\n- $\\mathrm{Rb}$:\n  1s$^2$ 2s$^2$ 2p$^6$ 3s$^2$ 3p$^6$ 3d$^{10}$ 4s$^2$ 4p$^6$ 5s,\n  so we fill up the 5s orbitals before the 4d and 4f orbitals.\n\n- $\\mathrm{Cs}$:\n  1s$^2$ 2s$^2$ 2p$^6$ 3s$^2$ 3p$^6$ 3d$^{10}$ 4s$^2$ 4p$^6$ 4d$^{10}$ 5s$^{2}$ 5p$^6$ 6s,\n  so we fill up the 6s orbitals before the 4f, 5d and 5f orbitals.\n\nThis structure can be nicely understood by the idea of screening as\nintroduced in the central field approximation. Consider for example the\n$\\mathrm{Na}$ for which one electron has to be on the third shell.\nWithin the hydrogen atom the 3s, 3p and 3d are degenerate, however the\nscreening will lift this degeneracy.\n\n- Electrons in the s-shell spend a lot of time close to the nucleus\n  and fill a strong binding potential, i.e. they have a low energy.\n\n- On the other extreme the electrons in the d-shell have large angular\n  momentum, which hinders them from getting close to the core. The 10\n  electrons can therefore efficiently screen the nucleus from the\n  electron. The energy of the d shell is therefore quite close to the\n  energy of the hydrogen atom.\n\nFor $\\mathrm{K}$ the same principle applies.\n\n- The 4s orbital is strongly shifted down to the strong nuclear\n  potential.\n\n- The 3d orbital is well screened by the other electrons, such that it\n  is of higher energy than the 4s orbit.\n\nWe can describe this effect empirically through the _quantum defect_. We\nsimply write down the energy levels as:\n\n$$\nE_{nl} \\cong -  R_{y,\\infty} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{1}{n-\\delta_l} \\right)^2,\n$$\n\nwhere $\\delta_l$ is the quantum defect for a certain\nvalue of $l$. Some examples are summarized in Fig.\n[6](#fig-quantum-defect).\n\n<figure id=\"fig-quantum-defect\">\n<img src=\"./lecture13_pic6.png\" width=\"70%\" />\n<figcaption>The quantum defect for different alkali atoms. Table 3.4 from Hertel 2015. </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThe effect of the quantum defect is actually so substantial that it\nintroduces optical transitions between the different subshells of Alkali\natoms.\n\n- For Li there is a $2s\\rightarrow 2p$ transition at 671 nm.\n\n- For Na there is a $3s\\rightarrow 3p$ transition at 589 nm.\n\n- For K there is a $4s\\rightarrow 4p$ transition at 767 nm and 770nm.\n\n- For Rb there is a $5s\\rightarrow 5p$ transition at 780 nm and at\n  795nm.\n\n- For Cs there is a $6s\\rightarrow 6p$ transition at 852 nm and at\n  894nm.\n\nWhat is the origin of these doublets ? The scaling of the splitting with\nthe nucleus indicates relativistic origins and the splitting is indeed\ndue to spin-orbit coupling, which we will discuss in the next lecture.",

    "content": "\nIn the last lecture we have seen that we can typically\ntreat complex atomic systems within the central field approximation.\n\n$$\n\\hat{H} = \\underbrace{\\sum_i^N \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\vec{\\nabla}^2_{\\vec{r}_i} + V_\\textrm{cf} (r_i) \\right)}_{\\hat{H}_0} + \\underbrace{\\sum^N_{j>i} \\left( \\frac{1}{r_{ij}} - S(r_i) \\right)}_{\\hat{H}_1}\n$$\n\nSo we we can can treat atoms through the shell structure known from the\n$\\mathrm{H}$ atom, but the screening lifts the $l$ degeneracy. For a\nsingle outer electron, we have even seen how this screening can be\ndescribed by the quantum defect.\n\nWe would now like to go beyond this simple picture and discuss the\nfollowing questions:\n\n- How should the residual term $\\hat{H}_1$ be taken into account?\n\n- How do we properly take into account the Pauli principle ?\n\n- How can we treat the fine-splitting ?\n\n# On the residual coupling\n\nIf we ignore the residual coupling, we obtain a spherically symmetric\nproblem, which implies that the angular momentum $\\vec{l}_i$ of each\nelectron is conserved. This conservation will be broken by\n$\\hat{H}_{1}$. However, these forces are internal, which implies that\nthe total angular momentum $\\vec{L} = \\sum_i \\vec{l}_i$ is conserved. So\nwe should label the states in the complex Hamiltonian by $\\vec{L}$.\n\nThe total angular momentum will then set the symmetry of the spatial\nwavefunction. As already discussed in some detail for the He atom, this\nhas wide-reaching consquence on the spin degree of freedom through\nexchange interaction.\n\n# The Pauli principle and spin\n\n- According to the Pauli principle, each single-particle state can be\n  occupied only by one electron. After distributing all electrons over\n  different single-particle eigenstates (\"orbitals\"), the resulting\n  state needs to be fully antisymmetrized (Slater determinant).\n\n- There is a simplification for atoms with many electrons: The angular\n  momenta and spins of a complete subshell with\n  $n,\\,l,\\,\\{m_{-l},\\cdots,m_l\\}$ add to zero and can be ignored in\n  the further considerations (\"shell structure\"). Note that this is\n  often broken in molecular binding!\n\n- Alkali atoms are the simplest atoms with shell structure: All but\n  one _valence_ electron add to $L=0,S=0$. The ground state thus has\n  $L=0,S=1/2$.\n\n- For more complex atoms, the valence electrons couple to a total\n  orbital angular momentum $L$ with a given symmetry according to\n  particle exchange.\n\nLet us have a look at two examples for light atoms, starting with\n$\\mathrm{He}$:\n\n- $1s^2 \\rightarrow L=0,S=0$. The corresponding term is $^1S$\n\n- $1s2s \\rightarrow L=0, \\{S=0,S=1\\}$. The corresponding terms are\n  $^1S$ and $^3S$. .\n\nThe electronic configuration of $\\mathrm{Si}$ is:\n\n$$\n\\underbrace{1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2}_{L=0,\\,S=0} 3p^2\n$$\n\nPer valence electron we have $l=1$ and $s=1/2$. So we\nget $L=0,1,2$ and $S=0,1$. Here $S=1$ means symmetry and $S=0$\nantisymmetry with respect to particle exchange. In principle we can form\nthe following terms:\n\n$$\n^1 S, ^3 S, ^1 P, ^3 P,^1 D,^3 D\n$$\n\nWhich of these terms can be fully antisymmetrized? Here,\nonly the terms $^1S$, $^3P$ and $^1D$ fulfill Pauli's principle. In\ngeneral the exchange interaction (seen in the discussion of He), will\nthen lower the energy of the states with high spins.\n\n## Optional: Symmetry of the $L$ states\n\nWe can construct the following $L$-states for them:\n\n$$\n\\left|L=2,M_L=2\\right\\rangle = \\left|\\overbrace{1^{l_1},\\overbrace{1}^{m_{l_1}};\\overbrace{1}^{l_2},\\overbrace{1}^{m_{l_2}}}\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\n$$\n\\left|L=1,M_L=0\\right\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} ( \\left|\\overbrace{1^{m_{l_1}},\\overbrace{-1}^{m_{l_2}}}\\right\\rangle - \\left|-1,1 )\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\n$$\n\\left|L=0,M_L=0\\right\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}(\\left|\\overbrace{1^{m_{l_1}},\\overbrace{-1}^{m_{l_2}}}\\right\\rangle - \\left|0,0\\right\\rangle + \\left|-1,1\\right\\rangle )\n$$\n\nThe first and third states are symmetric and the second state is antisymmetric with respect to particle\nexchange.\n\n# Fine splitting\n\nWe have already seen in the discussion of the hydrogen atom that\nrelativistic effects should be taken into account to fully understand\nthe level spectrum of different atoms. To take into account the spin, we\ncan decompose the Hamiltonian as follows:\n\n$$\n\n\\hat{H} = \\underbrace{\\sum_i^N \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\vec{\\nabla}^2_{\\vec{r}_i} + V_\\textrm{cf} (r_i) \\right)}_{\\hat{H}_0} + \\underbrace{\\sum^N_{j>i} \\left( \\frac{1}{r_{ij}} - S(r_i) \\right)}_{\\hat{H}_1} + \\underbrace{\\sum_i^N c_i(\\vec{r}_i) \\hat{\\vec{L}}_i \\cdot \\hat{\\vec{S}}_i}_{\\hat{H}_2}\n$$\n\nThe term $\\hat{H}_0$ is from the central field and the\nindependent particle model. The Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}_1$ results from the\nresidual electrostatic interaction and the Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}_2$ comes\nfrom the spin-orbit coupling of individual electrons.\n\nThe question is now which term dominates. Since\n$\\hat{H}_2 \\propto (Z\\alpha)^2$, we can ignore it if $Z$ is small. This\nis the case for light atoms.\n\nFor our example this means that $^3P$ is the lowest energy state.\nHowever, the triplet state has a multiplicity. Which are these states?\nThere has to be an additional degree of freedom. The total electronic\nangular momentum $\\hat{\\vec{J}} = \\hat{\\vec{L}} + \\hat{\\vec{S}}$ of the\natom is a conserved quantity. The basis\n\n$$\n\\left|L,S,M_\\textrm{l},M_\\textrm{s}\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nis therefore not the right basis, since $M_\\textrm{l}$\nand $M_\\textrm{s}$ are not conserved because of $LS$ coupling. The\ncorrect basis is\n\n$$\n\\left|L,S,J,M_\\textrm{j}\\right\\rangle.\n$$\n\nWhich $J$ corresponds to the ground state? If the\noutermost shell is more than half filled, the maximum $J$ value is the\nground state, otherwise, the ground state has the minimum $J$ value. In\nour example, $\\mathrm{Si}$: $^3P_0$ is the ground state!\n\nSo far, we have been concerned with the \"Russell-Saunders\" coupling,\nalso known as $LS$ coupling. However, for atoms with large $Z$, the term\n$\\hat{H}_2$ in the Hamiltonian might become large, since it is\nproportional to $(Z \\alpha)^2$. We can ignore $\\hat{H}_1$ instead.\n\nAccording to $\\hat{H}_2$ the individual electron orbital angular\nmomentum $l$ pairs with the spin $s$ of the same electron to form the\ntotal electron angular momentum $j$. This will lead us to the concept of\n$jj$ coupling. Let us consider carbon first (see\n[1](#693186){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"693186\"}). The ground state\nreads:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{C}: 1s^22s^22p^2.\n$$\n\nLet us consider one excited state:\n\n$$\n1s^22s^22p3s.\n$$\n\n<figure id=\"fig-ineff\">\n<img src=\"./lecture14_pic1.png\" width=\"70%\" />\n</figure>\n\nIn the figure above \"The splitting of levels in the first excited¬†$^1$ P and¬†$^3$P terms of\nthe carbon sequence. As¬†$Z$ increases, the two electrons change their\ncharacter from being in an¬†$LS$ coupled state to a $jj$ coupled state.\"\nIt is taken from <a href=\"http://www.pearson.com.au/products/A-C-Bransden-Joachain/Physics-of-Atoms-and-Molecules/9780582356924?R=9780582356924\">Bransden</a>.\n\nAccording to $LS$ coupling the total angular momentum of the two valence\nelectrons is $L=1$ and the total spin can be $S=0,1$. Thus, we should\nexpect a singlet and a triplet. For heavy atoms we can observe two\ndoublets instead of a singlet and a triplet. Because of the very strong\n$\\hat{\\vec{L}}_i \\cdot \\hat{\\vec{S}}_i$ coupling, $\\hat{\\vec{L}}$ and\n$\\hat{\\vec{S}}$ are no longer conserved quantities. On the contrary,\n$\\hat{\\vec{J}}$ still is a conserved quantity. In very heavy atoms,\n$l_i$ and $s_i$ couple to $j_i$ for each electron $i$. In our example we\nget\n\n$$\nl_1=0, s_1=\\frac{1}{2} \\qquad \\text{and} \\qquad l_2=1, s_2=\\frac{1}{2}\n$$\n\nfor electron $1$ and $2$ and thus\n\n$$\nj_1=\\frac{1}{2} \\qquad \\text{and}\\qquad j_2=\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{3}{2}.\n$$\n\nThe individual $j_i$ couple to a total orbital angular\nmomentum $J$ in the following manner:\n\n$$\nJ= \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ccc}0,1 & \\text{for} & (j_1,j_2)=\\left(\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\\\ && \\\\ 1,2 & \\text{for} &(j_1,j_2) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{3}{2}\\right) \\end{array} \\right.\n$$\n\n# Hyperfine splitting\n\nUntil now we have investigated the structure of the atom depending on:\n\n- The orbital angular momentum $\\vec{L}$, which defines the shells.\n\n- The total electronic angular momentum $\\vec{J} = \\vec{L} + \\vec{S}$,\n  which defines the fine structure because of the spin-orbit coupling.\n\nFurther the nucleus has a spin angular momentum $\\vec{I}$, which leads\nto a magnetic moment:\n\n$$\n\\vec{\\mu}_I= g_I \\mu_N \\vec{I}\n$$\n\nWe have introduced the new constants:\n\n- $g_I$, which is always in the order of one, but it changes due to\n  the changing structure of the different nuclei.\n\n- The _nuclear magneton_\n  $\\mu_N = \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_p}= \\frac{m_e}{m_p}\\mu_B$.\n\nFrom the values of the prefactors, we can immediatly deduce that the\nhyperfine structure will be roughly three orders of magnitude smaller\nthan the fine structure. As with the spin-orbit coupling this nuclear\nspin will experience the magnetic field produced by the motion of the\nelectrons $\\vec{B}_{el}$ and we have:\n\n$$\nH_{hfs} = -\\vec{\\mu}_I \\cdot \\vec{B}_{el}\\\\\n= A_{hfs}\\vec{I}\\vec{J}\n$$\n\nThis couples $\\vec{I}$ and $\\vec{J}$ and the full\nstructure is given by total angular momentum:\n\n$$\n\\vec{F} = \\vec{J} + \\vec{I}\n$$\n\n## Hydrogen\n\nIn hydrogen the ground state has no angular momentum and the spin is\nsimply $S=1/2$. The nucleus has the same, such that we have $I=1/2$ and\nthe groundstate splits into the $F=0$ and the $F=1$ doublet. They are\nseparated by an energy difference of $1.42$GHz. This corresponds to a\ntransition wavelength of 21 cm, which is widely used in astronomy.\n\n## Cesium clocks\n\nThe definition of time is based the hyperfine levels of Cs. Cs has just\none stable isotope Cs-133 with nuclear spin $I=7/2$. The ground state\nelectron is in the the 6s state in the $^2 S_{1/2}$ state. So the\ngroundstate splits into the $F=3$ and $F=4$ manifold. They are separated\nby 9.4GHz and the clicking between these transitions is our definition\nof time. The second is actually [defined as](https://www.physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/current.html):\n\n> The second is the duration of 9 192 631 770 periods of the radiation\n> corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of\n> the ground state of the cesium 133 atom.\n\nAll the other units have similiar definitions, except the embarrising\nkilogram. It is defined as:\n\n> The kilogram is the unit of mass; it is equal to the mass of the\n> international prototype of the kilogram.\n\nThis will change soon as the member states of _Bureau International des\nPoids et des Mesures_ decided to base the SI system on the measurement\nof fundamental constants instead of some prototypes. So, now the\nfundamental constants will have no errorbars left, as shown in Fig.\n[2](#fig-si-units).\n\n<figure id=\"fig-si-units\">\n<img src=\"./lecture14_pic2.png\" width=\"95%\" />\n<figcaption>This wallet card displays the fundamental constants and other physical values that will define a revised international system of units. Taken\nfrom <a href=\"http://https://www.nist.gov/si-redefinition/turning-point-humanity-redefining-worlds-measurement-system\"> the Blog of\nNIST</a>.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n## Bosonic and fermionic isotopes\n\nA particularly interesting problem is the influence of the nuclear spin\non how the atoms talk to each other. For example we have two different\nstable isotope of Li, namely Li $^6$ and Li$^7$, which only differ by one\nneutron in the nucleus. All the wavelengths for controlling the atoms\nare extremely similiar, however the hyperfine structure is different.\nFor Li$^6$ we have a nuclear spin of $I=1$ and for Li$^7$ $I=3/2$. The\nresulting total angular momentum\n\n- $F=1/2$ in the ground state of Li$^6$\n\n- $F=1$ in the ground state of Li$^7$\n\nSo one is of them is an integer spin boson and the other one is a spin\nhalf fermion. One can nicely see these differences as one tries to put\nthem onto each other for cold temperatures and tight traps as visualized\nin the Figure below and reproduced from [Truscott 2001](http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1059318).\n\n<figure id=\"fig-fermi\">\n<img src=\"./lecture14_pic3.png\" width=\"95%\" />\n</figure>",

A single electron,\nwhich is bound to two nuclei as shown in Fig.\n[1](#fig-hydrogen-ion).\n\n<figure id=\"fig-hydrogen-ion\">\n<img src=\"./lecture15_pic1.png\" width=\"60%\" />\n<figcaption>The molecular hydrogen ion as discussed in the main text.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThe full Hamiltonian of the system at study would read:\n\n$$\\hat{H} = - \\frac{1}{2}\\nabla_\\mathbf{r}^2 - \\frac{1}{2M}\\left(\\nabla_{\\mathbf{R}_\\mathrm{A}}^2 +\\nabla_{\\mathbf{R}_\\mathrm{B}}^2\\right) + V(\\mathbf{r}, \\mathbf{R}_\\mathrm{A}, \\mathbf{R}_\\mathrm{B})$$\nWe will further introduce the short-hand notations:\n\n$$\n\\hat{T}_e = - \\frac{1}{2}\\nabla_\\mathbf{r}^2 \\\\\n\\hat{T}_n = - \\frac{1}{2M}\\left(\\nabla_{\\mathbf{R}_\\mathrm{A}}^2 +\\nabla_{\\mathbf{R}_\\mathrm{B}}^2\\right)\n$$\n\nIn a stark difference to atoms, we now have two charged nuclei. The\nrelative distance between them and between the electron will be of major\nimportance. Most importantly, we should answer the question, why this\nconfiguration should be stable at all given that the two protons repel\neach other. To handle the problem, we will once again separate out\nenergy scales.\n\n## The Born-Oppenheimer approximation\n\nThe idea of the **Born-Oppenheimer approximation** is to separate the\nfast electronic motion from the slow motion of the heavy nuclueus\n($M=1836$). So we will\n\n1.  Solve the electronic motion with the nuclear coordinates fixed.\n\n2.  Solve the nuclear motion, assuming that the electron wavefunction\n    adapts instantaneously.\n\nSo the ansatz is:\n$$\\Psi(\\mathbf{R}_\\mathrm{A}, \\mathbf{R}_\\mathrm{B}, \\mathbf{r}) = \\psi_e(\\mathbf{R}_\\mathrm{A}, \\mathbf{R}_\\mathrm{B}, \\mathbf{r})\\cdot \\psi_n(\\mathbf{R}_\\mathrm{A}, \\mathbf{R}_\\mathrm{B})$$\n\nWe will plug this into the Schr√∂dinger equation to obtain:\n$$\\psi_n\\hat{T}_e\\psi_e +\\psi_e\\hat{T}_n\\psi_n + V(\\mathbf{r}, \\mathbf{R}_\\mathrm{A}, \\mathbf{R}_\\mathrm{B})\\psi_e \\psi_n + W = E \\psi_e\\psi_n$$\n\nThis transformation introduced the _non-adiabatic_ effects:\n$$W = -\\frac{1}{2M}\\sum_{i=A,B} \\left[(\\nabla_{\\mathbf{R}_i}\\psi_e)\\cdot(\\nabla_{\\mathbf{R}_i}\\psi_n)+\\psi_n \\nabla_{\\mathbf{R}_i}^2 \\psi_e\\right]$$\n\nIn the following we will neglect these effects. And obtain:\n$$\\psi_e \\hat{T}_n\\psi_n + \\left(\\hat{T}_e\\psi_e+V\\psi_e\\right)\\psi_n = E \\psi_e\\psi_n$$\nSo we will first solve the _electronic motion_:\n$$\\left(\\hat{T}_e+\\hat{V}\\right)\\psi_e = E_e(\\mathbf{R}_\\mathrm{A}, \\mathbf{R}_\\mathrm{B}) \\psi_e$$\nTo be explicit we obtain for the ionic hydrogen:\n\n$$\n\nH_e = -\\frac{1}{2} \\nabla_\\mathbf{r}^2-\\frac{1}{r_A}-\\frac{1}{r_B}+\\frac{1}{R}\n$$\n\nAt this stage we can just focus on the electronic part to understand the\nstructure of simple diatomic molecules, while assuming that $R$ is an\nindependent parameter. Most importantly, we will focus at usual on\nsymmetries, which will tell us more about the allowed states in the\nsystem.\n\nIn the second step we will solve the nuclear motion:\n$$\\hat{T}_n\\psi_n + E_e \\psi_n = E \\psi_n$$\n\nThis nuclear motion will be at the origin of rotational and vibrational\nlevels, which will be discussed in on of the next lectures.\n\n# Symmetries of the electronic wavefunction\n\nThis discussion follows along similiar lines as for the hydrogen atom\nand the helium atom. We basically can categorize the different states by\ntheir properties. This will help us later enormously to understand\nallowed transition etc.\n\n## Angular momentum\n\nFor any (diatomic) molecule we break the spherical symmetry that we\nrelied on for the atomic systems. This means that angular momentum is\nnot a conserved quantity anymore.\n\nHowever, the full Hamiltonian is invariant under the rotation around the\naxis of the diatomic molecule. One can verify that this implies that:\n\n$$\n[H_e, L_z] = 0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow L_z \\psi_e = \\pm \\Lambda \\psi_e (a.u.)\n$$\n\nThe reason is that\n$\\hat{L}_z =\\frac{1}{i}\\partial_\\varphi$ depends solely on the angle\n$\\varphi$ and not on $R$. Here the quantum number can have the integer\nvalues $\\Lambda= 0, 1, 2 , \\cdots$. We also note them\n$\\Sigma, \\Pi, \\Delta, \\Phi$ or $\\sigma, \\pi, \\delta, \\phi$ for single\nelectrons.\n\n## Parity\n\nWe further have symmetry under parity operation for _homo-nuclear,\ndiatomic_ molecules $A_2$. This means that we have once more:\n$$\\hat{P}\\psi_e(\\mathbf{r}) = \\pm\\psi_e(\\mathbf{r})$$ In the same way as\nin the lecture on the Helium atom we distinguish the states by _gerade_\nand _ungerade_. So we then end up with something like\n$\\Lambda_{u,g}^\\pm$.\n\n## Spin\n\nIf the system does not have explicit spin-orbit coupling, the total spin\n$S$ of the system will be conserved. So the full notation for electronic\nstates is typically: $$^{2S+1}\\Lambda^{\\pm}_{g,u}$$ Most of the time the\nground state of the system is $^{1}\\Sigma^{+}_{g}$.\n\n# Stability of the ground state molecule\n\nWe have now studied the symmetries that the system should have, but\nuntil now we did not discuss the most important question: Is this\nmolecule stable ? Within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, we can\nactually solve the ionic hydrogen molecule analytically (see [Chapter 9 of\nDemtr√∂der](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-10298-1)). The resulting **molecular potential curves** are\nshown in Fig. [2](#fig-potentials).\n\n<figure id=\"fig-potentials\">\n<img src=\"./lecture15_pic2.png\" width=\"60%\" />\n<figcaption>Molecular potential curves for the molecular hydrogen ion. Figure is\ntaken from <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/molecular-quantum-mechanics-9780199541423\">here</a>.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n## Linear combination of atomic orbitals\n\nThe analytical solutions are rather bulky and not particularly\ninstructive. One powerful idea, and very good approximation, is to\ndecompose the molecule wavefunction over the atomic orbitals of its\ncomponents. Going back to Fig. [1](#fig-hydrogen-ion) we could make the simple Ansatz:\n$$\\psi_e(\\mathbf{r})= c_1 \\psi_{1s}(\\mathbf{r}_\\mathrm{A})+c_2 \\psi_{1s}(\\mathbf{r}_\\mathrm{B})$$\n\nNote, that we made a very simple Ansatz at this stage and we could\ndecompose the system over a much larger set of excited states. But for\npedagogical reason we will stick to the simple model at this stage.\nGoing through the symmetry requirements, we find that we can write the\nfull wavefunction as:\n\n$$\n\\psi_{g,u}(\\mathbf{r})= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pm2S}}\\left(\\psi_{1s}(\\mathbf{r}_\\mathrm{A})\\pm \\psi_{1s}(\\mathbf{r}_\\mathrm{B})\\right)\n$$\n\nThe contribution $S$ describes the overlap of the two atomic orbitals\n$$S =  \\int d\\mathbf{r}\\psi_{1s}^*(\\mathbf{r}_\\mathrm{A})\\psi_{1s}(\\mathbf{r}_\\mathrm{B})$$\nWe can then evaluate the energy of the two states through the\nvariational principle:\n\n$$\nE_{g,u} = \\left\\langle\\psi_{g,u}\\right|\\hat{H}_e\\left|\\psi_{g,u}\\right\\rangle\\\\\n = \\frac{1}{2\\pm2S}\\left(\\left\\langle\\psi_A\\right|\\pm \\left\\langle\\psi_B\\right|\\right)\\hat{H}_e\\left(\\left|\\psi_A\\right\\rangle\\pm \\left|\\psi_B\\right\\rangle\\right)\\\\\n = \\frac{E_{AA}\\pm E_{AB}}{1\\pm S}\\\\\n$$\n\nThe resulting energy surfaces are shown in Fig. [3](#fig-lcao). In the most\nsimplistic interpretation the gerade state does not have a node in the\nmiddle and it is therefore of smaller kinetic energy.\n\n<figure id=\"fig-lcao\">\n<img src=\"./lecture15_pic3.svg\" width=\"70%\" />\n<figcaption>The energy surface of the LCAO for the hydrogen molecule ion.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n# The neutral hydrogen molecule\n\nIn the previous section we have seen how we can treat the coupling of\nthe nuclei through the exchange of a single shared electron. However, we\nshould now move on to the case of two neutral particles binding\ntogether. What is here the relevant mechanism ?\n\n<figure id=\"fig-hydrogen\">\n<img src=\"./lecture15_pic4.svg\" width=\"60%\" />\n<figcaption>The hydrogen molecule.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nIn the following we will only consider the electronic part, which adds\nup too:\n\n$$\\hat{H} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}_1}^2+\\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}_2}^2\\right)-\\frac{1}{r_{A1}}-\\frac{1}{r_{A2}}-\\frac{1}{r_{B1}}-\\frac{1}{r_{B2}}+\\frac{1}{r_{12}}+\\frac{1}{R}$$\n\nWe can now rewrite this Hamiltonian in the more instructive form\n\n$$\n\n\\hat{H} = H_{0,1}+H_{0,2}+\\frac{1}{r_{12}}+\\frac{1}{R}\\\\\nH_{0,i} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}_i}^2-\\frac{1}{r_{A,i}}-\\frac{1}{r_{B,i}}\n\n\n$$\n\nWe have can now use the results of the hydrogen ion to understand this\nsystem.\n\n- We have for each electron the solution of hydrogen molecule ion.\n- In the next step, we have to put the two electrons properly within\n  this orbit with $S=0$ and _ignoring_ the $e^-$ - $e^-$ interaction.\n\nSo we can make the Ansatz:\n\n$$\n\\psi(\\mathbf{r}_1, \\mathbf{r}_2) = \\psi_{g}(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\cdot\\psi_{g}(\\mathbf{r}_2)\\\\\n= \\frac{1}{2 + 2S}\\left(\\psi_{1s}(\\mathbf{r}_{A1})+\\psi_{1s}(\\mathbf{r}_{B1})\\right)\\left(\\psi_{1s}(\\mathbf{r}_{A2})+\\psi_{1s}(\\mathbf{r}_{B2})\\right)\\\\\n= \\frac{1}{2 + 2S}\\left(\\psi_{1s}(\\mathbf{r}_{A1})\\psi_{1s}(\\mathbf{r}_{B2})+\\psi_{1s}(\\mathbf{r}_{B1})\\psi_{1s}(\\mathbf{r}_{A2}) +\\psi_{1s}(\\mathbf{r}_{A1})\\psi_{1s}(\\mathbf{r}_{A2})+\\psi_{1s}(\\mathbf{r}_{B1})\\psi_{1s}(\\mathbf{r}_{B2}) \\right)\n$$\n\nThe first two terms describe **kovalent binding**. They\ndescribe situations where each electron is associated with one core. The\nlast two terms describe **ionic binding** as one associated both\nelectrons with a single atom and then looks one the attraction of\nanother ionic core. This is quite similiar to the interaction in the\n$H_2^+$ molecule.\n\nWithin this approach, one actually finds a binding energy of\n$E_b = {-2.64}\\text{eV}$ at an equilibrium distance of $R_e = 1.4 a_0$.\nThe experimentally measured values differs quite substantially as we\nhave $E_b = {-4.7}\\text{eV}$. A substantial approximation was here that we\nneglected the interaction between the electrons, which should repel.\n\n## The Heitler-London method\n\nAs the two electrons should repel each other, we can assume that the\nionic binding is strongly suppressed. So the wavefunction is now assumed\nto be:\n\n$$\n\n\\psi_{HL} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 + 2S^2}}\\left(\\psi_{1s}(\\mathbf{r}_{A1})\\psi_{1s}(\\mathbf{r}_{B2})+\\psi_{1s}(\\mathbf{r}_{B1})\\psi_{1s}(\\mathbf{r}_{A2})\\right)\n$$\n\nAgain, the wavefunction cannot be factorized and the two\nelectrons are entangled because of the interactions. Recognize the\ncommon theme with the Helium atom. Calculation of the binding energy\nwithin this approximation leads to $E_b = {-3.14}\\text{eV}$ and\n$R_e=1.6a_0$.\n\nIn the next lecture we will discuss how we can move on\nfrom these extremely simple diatomic molecules to the assembly of richer\nsystems.",

In\nthe last lecture we have seen two different binding processes of\nmolecular bonding:\n\n1.  Ionic binding, which was important in the $H_2^+$ molecule.\n\n2.  Kovalent binding, which dominated the $H_2$ molecule.\n\nBoth are important for small distances. For large distance the van der\nWaals interaction can create weakly bound molecules.\n\n<figure id=\"fig-hydrogen-overview\">\n<img src=\"./lecture16_pic1.png\" width=\"60%\" />\n<figcaption>Different binding mechanisms in diatomic molecules.

They do not share\nelectrons and they are neutral, so they do not have a permanent electric\ndipole moment. The magnetic dipole interaction is extremely weak anyway.\n\nThe key is induced dipole moment of the atom in in an electric field,\nseen in lecture 6. Each of the atoms can have a dipole\nmoment $\\mathbf{D}_i = q \\mathbf{r}_i$. As each atom is neutral, they\ninteract through their dipole-dipole interaction:\n\n$$\n\n\\hat{W}_{dd} =\\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0}\\frac{e^2}{R^3}\\left(\\mathbf{r}_A\\cdot \\mathbf{r}_B-3(\\mathbf{r}_A\\cdot \\mathbf{n})(\\mathbf{r}_B\\cdot \\mathbf{n})\\right)\n$$\n\nWe now have to perform the amplitude of this energy\nquantum mechanically. In a first step, we express $\\hat{W}_{dd}$ in\nterms of the operators $\\hat{X}_{A,B}, \\hat{Y}_{A,B}, \\hat{Z}_{A,B}$.\nThe orientation of the atom is sketched in the inset in Fig.\n[2](#fig-two-atoms).\n\n<figure id=\"fig-two-atoms\">\n<img src=\"./lecture16_pic2.svg\" width=\"60%\" />\n<figcaption>Configuration of two dipoles.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nWe can write then:\n\n$$\n\\hat{W}_{dd} =\\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0}\\frac{e^2}{R^3}\\left(\\hat{X}_A \\hat{X}_B + \\hat{Y}_A\\hat{Y}_B - 2 \\hat{Z}_A \\hat{Z}_B\\right)\n$$\n\nWe are only interested in their interaction at very large distances,\nsuch that we can treat the interaction perturbatively (see lecture 7). To first order, we have to evaluate:\n\n$$\nE_1 = \\left\\langle\\phi_{n,0,0^A, \\phi_{n,0,0}^B}\\right| \\hat{W}_{dd}\n\\left|\\phi_{n,0,0^A, \\phi_{n,0,0}^B}\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nIt only contains terms of the kind\n$\\left\\langle\\phi_{n,0,0^i}\\right| \\hat{X}_i \\left|\\phi_{n,0,0^i}\\right\\rangle$.\nAs the dipole moment is zero, the first order correction in the energy\nis zero too. The idea is then that the mean electric field created by\nthe atom might be zero. However, quantum mechanics allows for\nfluctuations of the type $\\langle |e\\mathbf{r}|^2\\rangle$. They are\ntaken into account through second order perturbation theory. We obtain\ndirectly:\n\n$$\nE_2 = \\sum_{\\phi,\\phi'} \\frac{|\\left\\langle\\psi_{\\phi^A,\\psi_{\\phi'}^B}\\right|\\hat{W}_{dd}\\left|\\psi_{0^A,\\psi_{0}^B}\\right\\rangle|^2}{(E_{0}^A+E_0^B -E_\\phi^A -E_{\\phi'}^B)}\n$$\n\nAnd we can also pull out the $R^3$ dependence of each\n$W$, to obtain a general expression for the **van-der-Waals\ninteraction**:\n\n$$\nE_2 = - \\frac{C_6}{R^6}\n$$\n\nTo get an estimate for the typical scale of the binding we can have a\nlook into the prefactor $C_6$. We will do this here for highly excited\nstates of hydrogen as it is relevant to the other alkalis too:\n\n- Each $\\hat{X}$ will be be proportional to the typical extension of\n  its orbit, such that we have $\\hat{X} \\sim n^2 a_0$ within the\n  electronic shells.\n\n- As for the energy difference, we know that the energy of high $n$\n  $E_n \\approx \\frac{ R_{y,\\infty}}{n^2}$ (the screening makes all\n  alkalis look very similiar for high energies). The energy difference\n  is therefore in the order of\n  $\\delta E_n \\approx \\frac{ R_{y,\\infty}}{n^3}$.\n\nPutting it all together, we obtain\n\n$$\nC_6 \\approx \\frac{e^4 a_0^4 n^8}{R_{y,\\infty}/n^3} \\approx \\frac{e^4 a_0^4}{R_{y,\\infty} (4\\pi\\epsilon_0)^2} n^{11}\n$$\n\nThis prediction has been directly tested as shown in Fig. [3](#fig-beguin).\n\n<figure id=\"fig-beguin\">\n<img src=\"./lecture16_pic3.svg\" width=\"60%\" />\n<figcaption>Direct measurement of the van-der-Waals force in <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/physrevlett.110.263201\">Beguin 2013</a>.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n# Molecular orbit theory\n\nWe would like to put together more complex molecules step-by-step. Let's\ntake a step back to the hydrogen molecule to formulate the problem.\n\n## The hydrogen molecule\n\nLet us have a brief look at H~2~ again and consider only contributions\nfrom $1s$ atomic orbitals. We saw that we can distribute the two\nelectrons within the gerade and ungerade orbital of the hydrogen ion. So\nour basic orbitals will be:\n\n$$\n\\sigma_g \\propto \\left( \\psi_{1s} (\\vec{r}_\\textrm{a}) + \\psi_{1s} (\\vec{r}_\\textrm{b}) \\right)\n$$\n\n$$\n\\sigma_u \\propto \\left( \\psi_{1s} (\\vec{r}_\\textrm{a}) - \\psi_{1s} (\\vec{r}_\\textrm{b}) \\right).\n$$\n\nLower case letters stand for the individual electrons\nwhile upper case letters characterize the whole system. We will now\nattempt to fill up the two orbitals with the two electrons:\n\n- Both electrons in a gerade orbital $1\\sigma_g^{2}$.\n\n- Both electrons in an ungerade orbital $1\\sigma_u^{2}$.\n\n- One electron in a gerade orbtial and one electron in an ungerade\n  orbital: $\\sigma_g^{1}1\\sigma_u^{1}$.\n\nIn a second step, we need to respect the Pauli principle for the two\nelectrons, which states that the full wavefunction should be\nanti-symmetric under exchange of particles. We had a detailled\ndiscussion of the topic on helium. So for the first\nconfiguration $1\\sigma_g^{2}$ we have:\n\n$$\n\\psi_1 \\propto \\sigma_g(1) \\cdot \\sigma_g(2) \\qquad (S=0, ^1\\Sigma_g)\n$$\n\nThe spin has to be in a singlet here as the wavefunction\nitself is symmetric. Further, the parity of the full wavefunction is\ngerade as $g \\times g = g$. So $\\psi_1$ is in a $^1\\Sigma_g$\nconfiguration.\n\nAs one atom is in $1\\sigma_g^{1}$ and the other one is in\n$1\\sigma_u^{1}$, the parity of the full wavefunction is $g\\times u = u$.\nAdditionally, we can choose which atom to position in which orbital and\nthen also the symmetry of the superposition. The symmetric superposition\nis:\n\n$$\n\\psi_{2} \\propto \\left (\\sigma_g(1) \\cdot \\sigma_u(2) + \\sigma_u(1) \\cdot \\sigma_u(2)\\right) \\quad \\qquad (S=0, ^1\\Sigma_u)\n$$\n\nAs the orbital superposition is symmetric, we once again\nhave work in a spin singlet to achieve the overall anti-symmetry of the\ntwo-electron wavefunction. So $\\psi_2$ is in a $^1\\Sigma_u$\nconfiguration.\n\nWe can also choose anti-symmetric superposition of the two\ndistinguishable orbitals:\n\n$$\n\\psi_3 \\propto \\left( \\sigma_g(1)\\cdot \\sigma_u(2)-\\sigma_u(1) \\cdot \\sigma_g(2) \\right) \\qquad (S=1, ^3\\Sigma_u)\n$$\n\nAs the orbital superposition is anti-symmetric, we have\nwork in a spin triplet to achieve the overall anti-symmetry of the\ntwo-electron wavefunction. So $\\psi_3$ is in a $^3\\Sigma_u$\nconfiguration.\n\nAnd finally we have for $1\\sigma_u^{2}$:\n\n$$\n\\psi_4 \\propto \\sigma_u(1)\\cdot \\sigma_u(2) \\qquad (S=0, ^1\\Sigma_g)\n$$\n\nThe spin has to be in a singlet here as the wavefunction\nitself is symmetric. Further, the parity of the full wavefunction is\ngerade as $u \\times u = g$. So $\\psi_4$ is in a $^1\\Sigma_g$\nconfiguration.\n\nAt short distance the energy ordering is\n$E(\\psi_1) < E(\\psi_2) \\sim E(\\psi_3) < E(\\psi_4)$.\n\n<figure >\n<img src=\"./lecture16_pic4.png\" width=\"60%\" />\n</figure>\n\nIn the figure above the faded lines indicate how the energy\nof¬†$\\psi_1$ and¬†$\\psi_4$ would naively. If the system is diagonalized in\na more flexible basis, that allows for superpositions, the orbits repel.\nTaken from¬†[here](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/molecular-quantum-mechanics-9780199541423).\n\nHowever for larger distances the gerade or ungerade character of each\nwave function becomes of less importance and the two configurations\n$\\psi_1$ and $\\psi_4$ become of similiar energy. They are further both\n$^1\\Sigma_g$ states. Therefore also all linear combinations of the two\nstates have the valid symmetries and and more flexibel trial solution\nwould be of the form:\n\n$$\nc_1 \\psi_1 + c_4 \\psi_4\n$$\n\nThe full solution then shows clear level repulsion\nbetween the two uncoupled channels. This concept is called\n\"configuration interaction\".\n\n## Conditions for (anti-)binding of particular orbitals.\n\nThe conditions for the creating of (anti-)binding orbitals is viusalized\nin Fig [5](#fig-binding).\n\nIn a first step, there has to be sufficient wave function overlap, such\nthat there can be constructive and destructive interference. This\nimplies that the orbit has to be large enough to 'see' the other atom,\nbut not to diffuse. This typically implies that only the valence shell\nhas to be considered.\n\nOnly orbits of the same symmetry group can form a bond. The main\nsymmetry property here is the total $L_z$ with respect to the axis of\nthe molecule. We have [table 4.5 of Demtr√∂der_2010](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/molecular-quantum-mechanics-9780199541423):\n\n- $s$, $p_z$ and $d_{z^2}$ have $L_z = 0$ ($\\Sigma$).\n\n- $p_x$, $p_y$ as well as $d_{yz}$, $d_{zx}$ have $|L_z| = 1$($\\Pi$)\n\nHaving a sufficient overlap is obviously not enough, the two orbits also\nhave to have the same a similiar energy, which is easily fulfilled in a\nhomonuclear molecule. But if we now have two different molecules the\norbital energy of (A) might be different from the orbital energy of (B).\nThe larger the difference, the smaller is the shift.\n\n<figure id=\"fig-binding\">\n<img src=\"./lecture16_pic5.png\" width=\"90%\" />\n<figcaption>Two atomic orbitals with resonant energy form a binding and\nanti-binding orbital. b) Molecular orbitals of heteronuclear molecules.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n# Homo-nuclear shell structure\n\nWe can finally put all this together to build up the shell structure of\nhomo-cuclear diatomic molecules as shown in Fig.\n[6](#fig-homo).\n\n<figure id=\"fig-homo\">\n<img src=\"./lecture16_pic6.png\" width=\"90%\" />\n<figcaption>The shell structure of some homonuclear diatomic molecules.

For the electronic energy\n$E_e$, only $\\vec{R} = \\vec{R}_\\textrm{a} - \\vec{R}_\\textrm{b}$ matters.\nWe then calculated the molecular potential curves $E_e(R)$, which differ\nfor each electronic configuration, discussed in the last lecture and sketched once more in Fig.\n[1](#fig-potential).\n\n<figure id=\"fig-potential\">\n<img src=\"./lecture17_pic1.png\" width=\"60%\" />\n<figcaption>The molecular potential curves obtained from the Born-Oppenheimer\nApproximation.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nIn the center of mass frame we can tranform and get:\n\n$$\n\\left( - \\frac{1}{2M} \\Delta_{\\vec{R}} + E_e (\\vec{R}) \\right) \\psi_\\textrm{n} (\\vec{R}) = E \\psi_\\textrm{n} (\\vec{R}),\n$$\n\n$\\vec{R}$ is spherically symmetric, and\n\n$$\nM = \\frac{M_\\textrm{a} \\cdot M_\\textrm{b}}{M_\\textrm{a} + M_\\textrm{b}}\n$$\n\nis the reduced mass. This means that we can separate the\nangular and radial motion to obtain:\n\n$$\n\\psi_\\textrm{n} (R,\\theta,\\varphi) = \\frac{1}{R} S(R) \\cdot Y_l^m (\\theta,\\varphi)\n$$\n\nThey describe the rotational and vibrational levels of\nthe nucleus.\n\n# Rotations\n\nIf we assume a \"rigid\" molecule where the distance between the atoms is\nfixed, the rotational energy is simply given by:\n\n$$\nE_\\text{rot} (R) = \\frac{J\\cdot (J+1)}{2M R^2}\\, (\\text{a.u.})\n$$\n\nwhere $M$ is the reduced mass of the nuclei in atomic\nunits and $J$ is the angular momentum quantum number. The factor $MR^2$\nrepresents the moment of inertia. For more complex atoms the\nrelationship is not quite as simple and the rotational energy is\ntypically described by the moment of interia $I_{ij}$. The Hamiltonian\nfor this rotation reads then:\n\n$$\n\\hat{H}_{rot} =\\frac{J_x^2}{2I_{xx}}+\\frac{J_y^2}{2I_{yy}}+\\frac{J_z^2}{2I_{zz}}\n$$\n\nThe molecule $H_2$ has then a rotational frequency\n$\\omega/2\\pi =3\\cdot 10^{12}\\cdot J(J+1) \\text{Hz}$.\n\n# Vibrations\n\nAs already known from the hydrogen atom we can use the angular solutions\nto discuss the radial solutions. We have to solve now:\n\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{1}{2M} \\frac{d^2}{dR^2} + E_e (R) + \\frac{1}{2M} \\frac{J(J+1)}{R^2} \\right) S(r) = E_\\text{vib} S(R)\n$$\n\nIf the extension from the minimum (see [2](#fig-internuclear)) is small, we can approximate it by a harmonic\npotential. We can then find a vibrational energy\n$E_\\text{vib} = \\omega_0 (\\nu+\\frac{1}{2})\\, \\nu=0,1,\\cdots$ The\nharmonic expansion around the minimum reads:\n\n$$\nE_e \\approx E_0 + \\frac{1}{2} M \\omega_0^2 (R-R_0 )^2\n$$\n\nFor the example of H~2~, we get $\\omega/2\\pi \\sim 10^{14}$ Hz.\n\n<figure id=\"fig-internuclear\">\n<img src=\"./lecture17_pic2.png\" width=\"60%\" />\n<figcaption>Internuclear potential. In the limit of a harmonic expansion around\nthe minimum, the vibrationally excited states are equidistant.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nA better approximation of the vibrational level structure than the\nsimple harmonic oscillator is the **Morse potential**.\n\n## The Morse potential\n\nIn this case we approximate the molecular potential curves by:\n\n$$\nE_e(R) \\approx V_\\text{morse}(R)\\\\\nV_\\text{morse}(R) =hcD_e(1-e^{-ax})^2\\text{ with }a =\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{2hcD_e}}\\\\\nx = R-R_0\n$$\n\nIts particular usefulness stems from the fact that it is\nstill analyitically solvable and we obtain:\n\n$$\nE_{vib}=(\\nu+\\frac{1}{2})\\hbar \\omega-(\\nu+\\frac{1}{2})^2 \\hbar \\omega x_e\\\\\n\\omega x_e = \\frac{a^2\\hbar}{2M}\n$$\n\n$x_e$ is then called the anharmonicity parameter.\n\n# Molecular transitions\n\nWe are now ready to discuss the different transitions that might appear\nin the spectrum. And we will work our way through the different levels\nof energy as we will see that they are all coupled.\n\n## Rotational transitions\n\nWe will start out with the transitions of the lowest frequency, the\nrotational transitions. So, we would like to know if it is possible to\ntransition from a state\n$\\left|\\epsilon, J, M_J\\right\\rangle$ to another state\n$\\left|\\epsilon, J', M_J'\\right\\rangle$, where $\\epsilon$\ndescribes the electronic and vibrational degree of freedom. This means\nthat we have to calculate as usual the the electric dipole moment:\n\n$$\n\\left\\langle\\epsilon, J', M_J'\\right| \\vec{D}\\left|\\epsilon, J, M_J\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nWithin the Born-Oppenheimer approximation electronic and\nrotational degree of freedom decouple and we can write:\n\n$$\n\\left\\langle\\epsilon, J', M_J'\\right| \\vec{D}\\left|\\epsilon, J, M_J\\right\\rangle = \\left\\langle J', M_J'\\right| \\left\\langle\\epsilon\\right|\\vec{D}\\left|\\epsilon\\right\\rangle\\left| J, M_J\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nThis electric dipole transitions were forbidden in atoms\nas they do not have a permanent electric dipole moment. However,\nhetero-nuclear atoms can have such a permanent electric dipole moment,\nthey are called polar molecules. Examples are alkali-alkali molecules\nlike NaK, NaCs, KRb whose permenanent electric dipole moment can be up\n$3 ea_0$. It follows that:\n\n- **Pure rotational transitions exist in polar molecules.**\n\nThe transition rules are di-atomic molecules: $\\Delta J = \\pm 1$ and\n$\\Delta M_J= 0, \\pm1$. For more complex molecules these transition rules\ncan vary quite substantially as the rotational degree of freedom might\nhave to be described by an additional quantum number.\n\n## Vibrational transitions\n\nIn the next step, we would like to understand the transitions between\ndifferent vibrational levels. Hence, we are investigating the electric\ndipole moment\n\n$$\n\\left\\langle\\epsilon, \\nu'\\right| \\vec{D}\\left|\\epsilon, \\nu\\right\\rangle= \\left\\langle\\nu'\\right| \\vec{D}_\\epsilon\\left|\\nu\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nThe evaluation is now not quite as simple as for the\nrotational degree of freedom as both $\\nu$ and $\\epsilon$ will influence\nthe length of the molecule, they both directly depend on $R$. We can\ndevelop the electric dipole moment as a function of distance from the\nequilibrium and write then:\n\n$$\n\\left\\langle\\nu'\\right| \\vec{D}_\\epsilon\\left|\\nu\\right\\rangle= \\left\\langle\\nu'\\right| \\left(\\vec{D}_\\epsilon(0)+ \\frac{d\\vec{D}_\\epsilon}{dx}x+\\cdots\\right)\\left|\\nu\\right\\rangle\\\\\n= \\frac{d\\vec{D}_\\epsilon}{dx}\\left\\langle\\nu'\\right|x\\left|\\nu\\right\\rangle+\\cdots\n$$\n\nSo vibrational transistions will only happen in\nmolecules for which the permanent electric dipole changes as a function\nof distance. Once again they are non-existant in homo-nuclear molecules.\n\n# Vibronic transitions\n\nAt this stage, we are ready to discuss electronic transitions. If we are\nperforming an electronic transition this also implies a change on the\nmolecular potential curve as indicated in Fig.\n[3](#fig-franck-condon). Imagine now the\ntransition of the ground state molecular branch (called the X branch) to\na higher electronic shell (called A, B, C, \\...). Such a transition will\nhappen at constant internuclear radius as they are much faster than the\nnuclei motion. This implies that an electronic transition will typically\nexcite the molecule into a high vibrational branch. The dipole moment is\nthen proportional too:\n\n$$\n\\left\\langle\\epsilon', \\nu'\\right| \\vec{D}\\left|\\epsilon, \\nu\\right\\rangle\\approx \\vec{D}_{\\epsilon, \\epsilon'} \\left\\langle\\nu'\\right| \\left|\\nu\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\n<figure id=\"fig-franck-condon\">\n<img src=\"./lecture17_pic3.png\" width=\"60%\" />\n<figcaption>The Franck-Condon principle for a simple toy model.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThe factor\n$S(\\nu, \\nu')=|\\left\\langle\\nu\\right|\\left|\\nu'\\right\\rangle|^2$\nis then called the Franck-Condon factor and it describes the strength of\nthe transitions.\n\nIt is exactly this coupling of different hierarchies that makes the\nmolecular spectra so rich and also extremely tough to control.\n\n# Can we get into the groundstate ?\n\nGiven all the complexities of molecules it seems non-trivial to find a\nscheme that gets them into the ground state. For atoms laser cooling has\nproven very efficient as we will discuss later. However, it mainly\nadresses the cooling of external degrees of freedom. In molecules a\nsignificant amount of energy its in the rotational and vibrational\nlevels. In this connection, a beautiful solution has been demonstrated\nin [Ni 2008](http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1163861).\n\nThe scheme is visualized in Fig. [4](#fig-ni2008).\n\n<figure id=\"fig-ni2008\">\n<img src=\"./lecture17_pic4.png\" width=\"60%\" />\n<figcaption>TProduction of groundstate molecules of K + Rb. Figure is taken from <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1163861\">Ni 2008</a>  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nIn a first step the atoms are cooled and then associated to a highly\nexcited molecule in the a^3^$\\Sigma$ state. From there the atom has to\nbe transferred down in to the ground state\n$\\left|g\\right\\rangle$. A direct thransfer is not possible\nas the Franck-Condon factors do not allow for it. Another path is to go\nthrough an intermediate level (here the 2$^3 \\Sigma$ level), which has\noverlap with both of them. However, this level has typically overlap\nwith plenty of other levels and a finite lifetime. How can we then\noptimize the transfer ? The idea is to use the concept of dark states in\nthe triplet of $\\{i, e, g\\}$.\n\n## The dark states in three level systems\n\nWe can visualize the idea of the dark state transfer through the\nfollowing Hamiltonian:\n\n$$\n\\hat{H}= \\Omega_1\\left(\\left|i\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle e\\right|+\\left|e\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle i\\right|\\right)+\\Omega_2\\left(\\left|g\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle e\\right|+\\left|e\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle g\\right|\\right)\n$$\n\nWe can rewrite it as:\n\n$$\n\\hat{H}= (\\Omega_1\\left|i\\right\\rangle+\\Omega_2\\left|g\\right\\rangle)\\left\\langle e\\right|+\\left|e\\right\\rangle(\\Omega_1\\left\\langle i\\right|+\\Omega_2\\left\\langle g\\right|)\\\\\n\\propto\\left|B\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle e\\right|+\\left|e\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle B\\right|\\\\\n\\left|B\\right\\rangle= \\frac{\\Omega_1\\left|i\\right\\rangle+\\Omega_2\\left|g\\right\\rangle}{\\sqrt{\\Omega_1^2+\\Omega_2^2}}\n$$\n\nSo in the three level scheme the excited state is always\ncould to the so-called bright state, which is a coherent superposition\nof $\\left|g\\right\\rangle$ and\n$\\left|i\\right\\rangle$. The orthogonal state is the dark\nstate:\n\n$$\n\\left|D\\right\\rangle= \\frac{\\Omega_1\\left|g\\right\\rangle-\\Omega_2\\left|i\\right\\rangle}{\\sqrt{\\Omega_1^2+\\Omega_2^2}}\\\\\n\\langle B| D\\rangle = 0\n$$\n\nNow we can also discuss the transfer sequence non as\nSTIRAP (stimulated Raman adiabatic passage).\n\n## STIRAP\n\nSTIRAP transfers the loosely bound molecules coherently into the\ngroundstate without ever passing through the lossy excited level. It has\nthe following steps:\n\n1.  The dressing laser $\\Omega_2$ is ramped on. The initial\n    $\\left|i\\right\\rangle$ is now the dark state.\n\n2.  The coupling laser $\\Omega_1$ is ramped on, while the laser\n    $\\Omega_2$ is ramped down. This transfers the\n    $\\left|i\\right\\rangle$ adiabatically into the state\n    $\\left|g\\right\\rangle$, which is the dark state for\n    fully switched of $\\Omega_2$.\n\nThe molecules are now in the groundstate with a transfer efficiency of\nroughly $50\\%$.\n\n# Measurement of the electron electric dipole moment\n\nDespite their complexity, molecules can be an enormously powerful tool\nfor precision measurements as you might find in [this](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/revmodphys.90.025008) or [this review](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.02504). The test of\nthe existance of a permanent electric dipole moment (electron edm) of\nthe electron is one of these tests.\n\nWhat does does the existance of electron edm actually mean ? We have\nalready discussed quite heavily the existance of a permanent edm for\npolar molecules. The amplitude of their dipole moment is in the order of\na few $ea_0$, which is also the natural unit for the induced edm of\natoms. One could now also imagine that the electron itself has an edm,\nwhich is aligned with its spin $\\vec{D}_e = d_e \\vec{s}_e$. The standard\nmodel actually predicts such a permanent electron edm, but only of the\namplitude $d_e \\approx 10^{-30}ea_0$, which is fantastically small .\nHowever, the search continues as most extensions of the standard model\nactually predict substantially higher values as summarized in Fig.\n[5](#fig-dipole). As we can see the\nmost precise measurments are actually performed in very heavy di-atomic\nmolecules.\n\nIn these molecules the electron 'feels' enormous effective electric\nfields, which can reach the [several GV/cm regime](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/physrevlett.119.153001).\n\n<figure id=\"fig-dipole\">\n<img src=\"./lecture17_pic5.png\" width=\"60%\" />\n<figcaption>Search for the permanent electric dipole moment. Figure is taken from <a href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10044/1/45291\">here</a>  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThe search for the dipole moment is then testing the dependence of the\nelectron energy:\n\n$$\nE_\\pm  = \\pm(\\mu B_0 + d_e E)\n$$\n\nThis energy difference can be read out through Ramsey\nspectroscopy. Switching the electric field allows then to switch the\nfrequency difference by $\\hbar \\delta \\omega = 4d_e E$. Only an upper\nlimit is known up to now $|d_e|< 8.7 e cm$.",

    "title": "Lecture 18 - Quantization of the Electromagnetic field",
    "content": "\nWe are looking into the quantization of the electromagnetic field. How\nto find the conjugate momenta and how we can identify the photon as a\nquantized particle.\n\nUntil now we exclusively treated the atom, molecule etc in a\nquantum-mechanical way. The electromagnetic field was always treated\nclassically. We will attempt to change that for various reasons:\n\n- Spontaneous emission and the Lamb shift can only be understood\n  within quantum electrodynamics.\n\n- Several experiments control the electromagnetic field at the single\n  photon level, so we have to understand how this works.\n\n- It frankly very unsatifying to only quantize half the problem.\n\nSo before we start the endevour let us start out with the some reminders\non the properties of radiation in classical electromagnetism.\n\n# Maxwell's Equations and Vector Potential\n\nElectrodynamics is described by Maxwell's equations:\n\n$$\n\\vec{\\nabla} \\cdot \\vec{B} = 0\\\\\n\\vec{\\nabla} \\times \\vec{E} + \\frac{\\partial \\vec{B}}{\\partial t}=0\\\\\n\\vec{\\nabla} \\cdot \\vec{E} = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_0}\\rho(\\vec{r},t) \\\\\n\\vec{\\nabla} \\times \\vec{B} = \\frac{1}{c^2} \\frac{\\partial \\vec{E}}{\\partial t}+\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_0 c^2}\\vec{j}\n$$\n\nThese equations are the equations of motion for the\nelectromagnetic field. The first two are the homogeneous Maxwell\nequations and we can directly solve them by setting:\n\n$$\n\\vec{B} = \\vec{\\nabla}\\times\\vec{A}\\\\\n\\vec{E}= -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}A-\\nabla \\phi\n$$\n\nQuite importantly, the choice of the potential $\\vec{A}$\nhas an inherent gauge freedom as we can basically perform the _local\ngauge transformation_:\n\n$$\n\\vec{A} \\rightarrow \\vec{A} + \\vec{\\nabla} f (\\vec{r},t)\\\\\n\\phi \\rightarrow \\phi - \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t}\n$$\n\nSo we can transform the electromagnetic field and the\nmagnetic field, but the equations of motion remain the same. It is this\nlocal gauge freedom, which also allows us to have charge conservation.\nBut it is also this gauge freedom, which will make the quantization\nrather technically involved.\n\n## Free radiation\n\nTo simplify the problem, we will actually, only work on free\nelectromagnetic radiation, which simplifies the remaining Maxwell\nequations too:\n\n$$\n\\vec{\\nabla} \\cdot \\vec{E} = 0 \\\\\n\\vec{\\nabla} \\times \\vec{B} = \\frac{1}{c^2} \\frac{\\partial\\vec{E}}{\\partial t}\n$$\n\nThey become very simple to within the **Coulomb gauge**,\nwere we fix:\n\n$$\n\n\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{A} = 0\n$$\n\nFor the electric field we have:\n\n$$\n\\vec{\\nabla} \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}A-\\nabla \\phi\\right) = 0 \\\\\n-\\Delta \\phi = 0\n$$\n\nThis is solved through the boring solution $\\phi = 0$.\nFor the magnetic field we obtain[^1]:\n\n$$\n\\vec{\\nabla} \\times (\\nabla \\times \\vec{A}) = -\\frac{1}{c^2} \\frac{\\partial^2\\vec{A}}{\\partial t^2}\\\\\n\\nabla^2 \\vec{A}  -\\frac{1}{c^2} \\frac{\\partial^2\\vec{A}}{\\partial t^2}=0\n$$\n\n## Solution in terms of plane waves\n\nWe can directly solve the problem, by using the Fourier representation:\n\n$$\n\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t)= \\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^{3/2}}\\int d^3\\vec{k}\\vec{A}(\\vec{k},t)e^{i\\vec{k}\\vec{r}}\n$$\n\nWe then find that the solutions fulfill the requirement:\n\n$$\n\\left(\\vec{k}^2 +\\frac{1}{c^2} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial t^2}\\right)\\vec{A}(\\vec{k},t)=0\n$$\n\nSo the free radiation describes a travelling wave in the direction\n$\\vec{k}$. The coulomb gauge further tells us that the vector potential only\nhas components, which are orthogonal to $\\vec{k}$ as:\n\n$$\n\\vec{k}\\cdot\\vec{A} = 0\\\\\n\\vec{A}(\\vec{k}) = \\vec{e}_1 A_1(\\vec{k}) + \\vec{e}_2 A_2(\\vec{k})\n$$\n\nGiven that these equations of motion for the vector potential look a lot\nlike the ones of a harmonic oscillator, let us go through the\nquantization of the harmonic oscillator first.\n\n# Quantization procedure for the harmonic oscillator\n\nTo the the problem, we first have to go back the cooking recipe for the\nquantization of a classical problem. In a first step, we have to obtain\nthe relevant Lagrangian. Knowing what is it, is a rather interesting\nartform of theoretical physics, but for most cases you might just take\nit as a given thing. We have:\n\n$$\nL_{HO} = \\frac{1}{2}m\\dot{x}^2-\\frac{m\\omega^2}{2}x^2\n$$\n\nWe can now identify the conjugate momentum as:\n\n$$\np = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{x}}\\\\\n = m\\dot{x}\n$$\n\nAt this stage we can calculate the Hamiltonian:\n\n$$\nH = \\dot{x}p - L\\\\\nH_{HO} = \\frac{p^2}{2m}+\\frac{m\\omega^2}{2}x^2\n$$\n\nAt this stage we can identify the classical equations of\nmotion through:\n\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt}= \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p}\\\\\n\\frac{dp}{dt}= -\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial x}\n$$\n\nIt results just in the usual Newtons law. To get now the\nquantum formulation, we can quantize the system by imposing the\ncommutation relationship on position and its conjugate momentum:\n\n$$\n~[\\hat{x}, \\hat{p}] = i\\hbar\n$$\n\nWe then had the final Hamiltonian:\n\n$$\n\\hat{H} = \\frac{\\hat{p}^2}{2m}+\\frac{m\\omega^2}{2}\\hat{x}^2\n$$\n\nHowever, we know from the previous lecture that it is\nmuch nicer to work in the basis of raising and lowering operators:\n\n$$\n\\hat{a} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\hbar}}\\left(\\sqrt{m\\omega}x+i\\frac{p}{\\sqrt{m\\omega}}\\right)\\\\\n\\hat{a}^\\dag = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\hbar}}\\left(\\sqrt{m\\omega}x-i\\frac{p}{\\sqrt{m\\omega}}\\right)\\\\\n~[\\hat{a}, \\hat{a}^\\dag] =1\n$$\n\nfor which we obtain:\n\n$$\n\\hat{H} =\\hbar\\omega\\left(\\hat{a}^\\dag \\hat{a}+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\n$$\n\n# The lagrangien for the electromagnetism\n\nAt this stage we would like to roll out the formalism for\nelectromagnetism, following the discussion of [Cohen-Tannoudji Vol 3\n(appendix of 18)](https://laboutique.edpsciences.fr/produit/1061/9782759823369/mecanique-quantique-tome-3). It adds sequentially the following new\nproblems, which we will tackle as we get to them:\n\n- The Lagrangien has plenty degrees of freedom.\n\n- The dynamical variables are complex.\n\nWe start out with the Lagrangien:\n\n$$\nL = \\int d^3r \\mathcal{L}(\\vec{r},t)\\\\\n\\mathcal{L}(\\vec{r},t)= \\frac{\\epsilon_0}{2}\\left(\\vec{E}^2-c^2\\vec{B}^2\\right)\n$$\n\nAs it depends explicitly on the electric and magnetic\nfield it is manifestly gauge invariant. However, the current version\ndoes not allow us to to identify the conjugate variables. We will use\nthe vector potential to introduce them:\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}(\\vec{r},t)= \\frac{\\epsilon_0}{2}\\left(\\dot{\\vec{A}}^2(\\vec{r},t)-c^2\\left(\\nabla \\times \\vec{A}\\right)^2\\right)\n$$\n\nNow we obtained the time derivative, which we can employ\nto identify the conjugate momentum, but it also gave us the unwanted rot\nterm. We get rid of them transforming into Fourier space: We can then\nwrite:\n\n$$\n\\int d\\vec{r} \\vec{E}(\\vec{r},t)\\vec{E}(\\vec{r},t)= \\int d\\vec{k} \\dot{\\vec{A}}(\\vec{k},t)\\dot{\\vec{A}}^*(\\vec{k},t)\\\\\n\\int d\\vec{r} \\vec{B}(\\vec{r},t)\\vec{B}(\\vec{r},t)= \\int d\\vec{k}k^2 \\vec{A}(\\vec{k},t)\\vec{A}^*(\\vec{k},t)\\\\\n$$\n\nWe can then write the Lagrangien as:\n\n$$\nL = \\int d^3k \\mathcal{L}(\\vec{k},t)\\\\\n\\mathcal{L}(\\vec{k},t) = \\epsilon_0\\left( \\dot{\\vec{A}}(\\vec{k},t)\\dot{\\vec{A}}^*(\\vec{k},t)-c^2k^2 \\vec{A}(\\vec{k},t)\\vec{A}^*(\\vec{k},t)\\right)\n$$\n\nAs for the integral over $\\vec{k}$, we will only\nintegrate over the positive contributions. This avoids summing over\nidentical terms at $\\vec{k}$ and $-\\vec{k}$. Finally, we can also use\nthe polarization to obtain:\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}(\\vec{k},t)= \\epsilon_0\\sum_i \\left( \\dot{A}_i(\\vec{k},t)\\dot{A}_i^*(\\vec{k},t)-c^2k^2 A_i(\\vec{k},t)A_i^*(\\vec{k},t)\\right)\n$$\n\n## The conjugate moment and hamiltonian\n\nWe have discussed in the section on the quantization of the harmonic oscillator how to find the conjugate momentum for classical\nvariables. Here, we have complex variables. But, we can deduce the\nconjugate momentum through as decomposition $X = x_1 + i x_2$. We\nactually obtain:\n\n$$\nP = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{X}^*}\n$$\n\nHere, it implies that the conjugate momentum $\\Pi_i(\\vec{k})$ is\n\n$$\n\\Pi_i(\\vec{k}) = \\frac{\\partial\\mathcal{L}(\\vec{k},t)}{\\partial \\dot{A}^*_i(\\vec{k},t)}\\\\\n= \\epsilon_0 \\dot{A}_i(\\vec{k},t)\\\\\n= -\\epsilon_0 E_i(\\vec{k},t)\n$$\n\n**So the conjugate momentum to the vector potential is\nthe electric field.**\n\nWe can now calculate the Hamiltonian before we quantize the system.

    "content": "\nWe have seen that we can understand matter with increasing complexity\nfrom the simple two-level system up to molecules. We further studied,\nhow they can be control by classical electromagnetic fields to a very\nhigh accuracy.\n\nIn the last lecture we also studied how we can understand the\nelectromagnetic field as an ensemble of quantum mechanical photon modes.\nSo in today's lecture we will focus on the interaction between atoms and\nlight, which is in a particularly clean set-up, namely cavity quantum\nelectrodynamics. The fundamental ingredients are sketched in Fig.\n[1](#fig-rydberg).\n\n<figure id=\"fig-rydberg\">\n<img src=\"./lecture19_pic1.png\" width=\"60%\" />\n<figcaption>Rydberg atoms interacting with the photons confined in a high quality\ncavity. Picture taken from the Nobel prize announcement for Serge\nHaroche <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2012/popular-information/\">here</a>  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThey are:\n\n- The electric field confined in a high finesse cavity. It will\n  bescribed by $\\hat{H}_\\textrm{f}$.\n\n- An atom transversing the cavity, described by $\\hat{H}_\\textrm{a}$.\n\n- The interaction between the atomic charge and the electric field of\n  the cavity described by $\\hat{H}_\\textrm{af}$.\n\nThe Hamiltonian reads:\n\n$$\n\n\\hat{H}_0 = \\hat{H}_\\textrm{a} + \\hat{H}_\\textrm{f} + \\hat{H}_\\textrm{af}\n$$\n\n# The qubit system\n\nThe first ingredient of the Hamiltonian is the qubit system. Several\nwidely studied system that we will come back to exist. The most widely\nstudied are:\n\n1.  The internal qubit states of ions.\n\n2.  The transmon qubit in superconducting systems.\n\nAnother approach are well isolated states in atoms, namely **Rydberg**\nstates.\n\n## Rydberg atoms\n\nThe Rydberg states are highly excited states of Alkali atoms, which have\nonly one electron on the outer shell. As such they are similiar to the\nhydrogen atom and hence they can be well described within atomic\nphysics. In the hydrogen atom the energy states are described by the\nprinciple quantum number $n$:\n\n$$\nE_n = -E_I \\frac{1}{n^2} \\text{ with }E_I = 13.6 eV\n$$\n\nThe typically employed Rydberg states are then in the\norder of $n\\approx 50$, such that the energy difference between two\nneighboring states is in the order of a few 50 GHz. Focusing only on two\nof those states we can write the Hamiltonian as:\n\n$$\n\\hat{H}_\\textrm{a} = \\frac{\\hbar\\omega_0}{2} \\left(\\left|e\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle e\\right|-\\left|g\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle g\\right| \\right)\n$$\n\nThrough the remainder of the lecture we will frequently\nswitch notations between the spin language and the two-level system:\n\n$$\n\\hat{\\sigma}_z = \\left|e\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle e\\right|-\\left|g\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle g\\right|\\\\\n\\hat{\\sigma}_+ = \\left|e\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle g\\right|\\\\\n\\hat{\\sigma}_- = \\left|g\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle e\\right|\n$$\n\nUsing these highly excited states has several advantages:\n\n- The energy spacing of a few GHz falls into the regime of microwaves,\n  which are extremely precisely controlled.\n\n- Given the high quantum number, the electron is typically far away\n  from the nucleus and the induced dipole moments can be rather\n  large.As a such a strong coupling between light-field and qubit\n  seems achievable.\n\n- The lifetime of the Rydberg states is in the order of a few\n  microseconds, which can be long compared to most other time scales\n  within the experiments.\n\nThe next step is to couple qubit to a suitable cavity.\n\n# The cavity field\n\nThe atom has be coupled to a suitable electric field. The electric field\nreads in general:\n\n$$\n\\hat{E}(\\vec{r})= i \\int \\frac{d\\vec{k}}{(2\\pi)^{3/2}}\\sum_i \\left(\\frac{\\hbar\\omega}{2\\epsilon_0}\\right)\\vec{e}_i\\left(\\hat{a}_i(\\vec{k})e^{i\\vec{k}\\vec{r}}-\\hat{a}^\\dag_i(\\vec{k})e^{-i\\vec{k}\\vec{r}}\\right)\n$$\n\nWe can simplify it a lot by working in a suitable\ncavity. The most important properties of the cavity are the:\n\n- The resonant frequency $\\omega_L$ of the light trapped in the\n  cavity.\n\n- The quality factor $Q$, which describes the number of round trips\n  the photon makes within the cavity.\n\nThe cavities employed for cavity electrodynamics in Paris are made of\nsuperconducting material and feature quality factors of up to $10^{10}$.\nFor such high quality factors the electric field can be well reduced to\na single relevant mode [^1]:\n\n$$\n\\hat{E} \\sim (\\hat{a} + \\hat{a}^\\dag)\n$$\n\nThe full Hamiltonian of the electromagnetic field reads\nthen [^2]:\n\n$$\n\\hat{H}_\\textrm{f} = \\hbar\\omega_L \\hat{a}^\\dag \\hat{a}\n$$\n\nThe $\\hat{a}$ is the raising operator for the\nelectro-magnetic field. We typcially describe the electric field in the\nFock basis of $\\left|n\\right\\rangle$.\n\n$$\n\\hat{n} \\left|n\\right\\rangle = n \\left|n\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nWhile is the natural choice for the given Hamiltonian,\nthis is obviously not the natural basis of the raising and lowering\noperators:\n\n$$\n\\hat{a} \\left|n\\right\\rangle = \\sqrt{n} \\left|n-1\\right\\rangle\\\\\n\\hat{a}^\\dag \\left|n\\right\\rangle = \\sqrt{n+1} \\left|n+1\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nFrom those we can construct any Fock state as:\n\n$$\n\\left|n\\right\\rangle = \\frac{\\left(\\hat{a}^\\dag\\right)^n}{n!}\\left|0\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nBut experimentally we rarely manipulate the Hamiltonian\ndirectly, we much rather control the electric field, which is\nproportional to the raising and lowering operators. As such, photon\nstates are widely described in the basis of **coherent** states:\n\n$$\n\\hat{a}\\left|\\alpha\\right\\rangle= \\alpha\\left|\\alpha\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nSo the eigenvalues are complex numbers corresponding to\nthe complex electric field amplitudes we know from classical optics. To\nmake a connection to the Fock space we can then use the above\ndefinitions to write:\n\n$$\n\\left|\\alpha\\right\\rangle =e^{-|\\alpha|^2/2}\\sum_n \\frac{\\alpha^n}{\\sqrt{n!}}\\left|n\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nA very useful visualization of the coherent states\nhappens in phase space $X = \\frac{a+a^\\dag}{2}$ and\n$P = i\\frac{a-a^\\dag}{2}$. They are Gaussian wave packages displaced by\nan amplitude $|\\alpha|$ and rotating at speed $\\omega_L$.\n\n# The atom-field interaction\n\nFinally, we have to describe interaction between the atoms and the\nfield. Interactions between the atoms and the light field are governed\nby the electric dipole interaction between the atom and the light\n\n$$\n\\hat{H}_\\textrm{af}= -\\hat{\\vec{D}} \\cdot \\hat{\\vec{E}}\n$$\n\nWe can expand the dipole operator over the two levels of\nthe atom:\n\n$$\n\\hat{\\vec{D}} = \\vec{d}\\left(\\left|g\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle e\\right|+\\left|e\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle g\\right|\\right)\\\\\n\\hat{\\vec{D}} = \\vec{d}\\left(\\hat{\\sigma}_- + \\hat{\\sigma}_+\\right)\n$$\n\nWe can now write:\n\n$$\n\\hat{H}_\\textrm{af}= \\frac{\\hbar \\Omega_0}{2} \\left(\\left|g\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle e\\right|+\\left|e\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle g\\right|\\right)\\left(\\hat{a}+\\hat{a}^\\dag\\right)\n$$\n\nMultiplying out the different the two brackets leads to two processes of\nthe type:\n\n- $\\hat{\\sigma}_- \\hat{a}^\\dag$, which describes the emission of a\n  photon by deexcitation of the atom.\n\n- $\\hat{\\sigma}_+ \\hat{a}$, which describes the absorption of a photon\n  by excitation of the atom.\n\nThe other two processes are strongly off-resonant and we can typically\nignore them. This approximation consists in the rotating wave\napproximation, discussed in lecture 4. The coupling\nhamiltonian reads then:\n\n$$\n\\hat{H}_\\textrm{af}= \\frac{\\hbar \\Omega_0}{2} \\left(\\hat{\\sigma}_- a^\\dag +\\hat{\\sigma}_+ a\\right)\n$$\n\nWe can put the full Hamiltonian together to obtain the Jaynes-Cummings\nmodel:\n\n$$\nH_{JC}=\\hbar\\omega_0 \\left|e\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle e\\right| +\\hbar\\omega_L \\hat{a}^\\dag \\hat{a} +\\frac{\\hbar \\Omega_0}{2} \\left(\\hat{\\sigma}_- a^\\dag +\\hat{\\sigma}_+ a\\right)\n$$\n\n# Dressed Atom Picture\n\nWe can now analyze the Hamiltonian step-by-step in the dressed atom\npicture.\n\n## Optional: Bare States\n\nLet us first look at the unperturbed (\\\"bare\\\") states, ignoring\n$H_\\textrm{af}$ and depict the ground and excited state\n$\\left|g\\right\\rangle$ and\n$\\left|e\\right\\rangle$ of the atom on an energy scale, as\nshown in below.\n\n<figure id=\"fig-rydberg\">\n<img src=\"./lecture19_pic2.png\" width=\"60%\" />\n</figure>\n\nThe ground and excited state¬†$\\left|g\\right\\rangle$\nand¬†$\\left|e\\right\\rangle$ of the atom on an energy scale. Here, the\nenergy of the ground state is¬†$E_g\\ =\\ 0$. The energy difference between\nthe two states is $\\hbar\\omega_0$. A photon of the surrounding light\nfield has an energy $\\hbar\\omega_L$. The Hamiltonian of the system then reads\n\n$$\n\\hat{H} = \\hat{H}_\\textrm{a} + \\hat{H}_\\textrm{f} = \\hbar \\omega_0 \\left|e\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle e\\right| + \\hbar \\omega_\\textrm{L} \\hat{a}^\\dag \\hat{a}\n$$\n\nThe Hilbert space of this Hamiltonian contains both the state of the\natom and the state of the field. We can write them as product states of\nthe form\n\n$$\n\\left|g/e, n\\right\\rangle = \\left|g/e\\right\\rangle \\otimes \\left|n\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nThe left substate of the tensor product denotes the\nstate of the atom and the right substate is defined by the number of\nphotons in the external field. We then have:\n\n$$\n\\hat{H}\\left|g/e, n\\right\\rangle = \\left(\\hbar\\omega_0 \\delta_{g/e,e}+\\hbar\\omega_L n\\right)\\left|g/e, n\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nWe will assume that there is a very small detuning $\\delta_\\textrm{l}$\nbetween the atom and the light field:\n\n$$\n|\\delta_\\textrm{l}| = |\\omega_\\textrm{L}- \\omega_0 | \\ll \\omega_0\n$$\n\n<figure id=\"fig-bare-diagram\">\n<img src=\"./lecture19_pic3.png\" width=\"60%\" />\n<figcaption>An energy diagram of the bare states.

This projection can be avoided by\nadding a second Ramsey pulse, which mixes once again the states\n$\\left|e\\right\\rangle$ and\n$\\left|g\\right\\rangle$:\n\n$$\n\\left|e\\right\\rangle\\rightarrow\\frac{\\left|e\\right\\rangle+e^{i\\varphi}\\left|g\\right\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}\\\\\n\\left|g\\right\\rangle\\rightarrow\\frac{\\left|g\\right\\rangle-e^{-i\\varphi}\\left|e\\right\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}\n$$\n\nThe field now becomes:\n\n$$\n\\left|\\Psi_2\\right\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}\\left|e\\right\\rangle\\otimes\\left[e^{-i\\Phi_0}\\left|\\alpha e^{-i\\Phi_0}\\right\\rangle-e^{-i\\varphi}\\left|\\alpha e^{i\\Phi_0}\\right\\rangle\\right]+\\frac{1}{2}\\left|g\\right\\rangle\\otimes\\left[e^{i(\\varphi-\\Phi_0)}\\left|\\alpha e^{-i\\Phi_0}\\right\\rangle+\\left|\\alpha e^{i\\Phi_0}\\right\\rangle\\right]\n$$\n\nThe final read-out is then given by:\n\n$$\nP_e = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1- e^{-n(1-\\cos(2\\Phi_0))}\\cos(\\varphi-\\Phi_0-n\\sin(2\\Phi_0))\\right)\n$$\n\nSo the presence of the cat leads to a phase shift and a\ndecrease in fringe contrast.\n\nNowadays the entangled states have become an interesting platform to\ncreate increasingly large Schr√∂dinger cats. A common example is here the\ncreation of a GHZ state:\n\n$$\n\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle = \\frac{\\left|0 \\cdots 0\\right\\rangle+ \\left|1\\cdots 1\\right\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}\n$$\n\nA interesting demonstration for up to 14 ions was performed in\n[Monz 2011](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.106.130506). Importantly it also highlights the extremely fast decoherence of larger cat states. We will go into more detail on how to\ncreate increasingly larger cats in the next lecture. However, I would\nlike to finish the lecture with the discussion of quantum non-demolition\nmeasurements.\n\nAs of the time of writing cold atom systems systems [rOmran 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05721) cold\nthe record of the largest cat with 20 atoms.\n\n# Seeing a photon without destroying it\n\nThe tool of the Rabi oscillations has been extend to observe photons\nwithout destroying them as detailed in great detail in the book by\n[Raymond and Haroche](https://academic.oup.com/book/7346). The underlying principle is the\nfollowing:\n\n- The atom is supposed to be in the ground state and the cavity is\n  filled with one photon.\n\n- The interaction time is tuned such that the atom undergoes exactly\n  one Rabi oscillation.\n\n- The initial and final state are therefore exactly the same, but the\n  atom has picked up a phase $\\pi$.\n\nIf the cavity was empty at the atom does not acquire a phase shift.\n\nFinally, the phase is read out through a Ramsey sequence between the\nstate $g$ and some unaffected independent state $i$ . This was implemented in Ref. [Nogues 1999](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/22275). Based on this technique,\nthe team later observed quantum jumps [Gleyzes 2007](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature05589) and even the\nstabilization of a Fock state through quantum feedback [Sayrin 2011](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature10376).\n\n[^1]:\n    We chose the phase of the electric field such that we can\n    eliminate the minus sign in the Hamiltonian\n\n[^2]:\n    We ignore the energy of the quantum vacuum as it is not relevant\n    for the following discussions",

    "content": "\nIn this lecture we are going to discuss the fundamental ingredients for\nquantum computing with trapped ions. In a first step, we discuss\ntrapping and cooling, then single qubit operations and finally two-qubit\noperations.\n\nQuantum computation has become a branch of research at the interaction\nof physics, engineering, mathematices and computer science by now. The\nstandard book on the topic is most likely the book by Nielsen and Chang\n[Nielsen 2009](http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/cbo9780511976667). However, an enormous amount of additional literature\nexists, I will only reference here to [a nice introduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03719v1) a\nmore complete list is left for future discussions.\n\nIn this lecture we will discuss shortly the idea behind quantum\ncomputing and the discuss its implementation on trapped ions. While a\nlarge number of them exist, we decided to start with trapped ions for\nseveral very subjective reasons [^1].\n\nAnd before we can start the discussion we would highly recommend the\nreaders to take some time to go through the Nobel prize lecture of Dave\nWineland as it gives a detailled discussion of the field from his point\nof view [Wineland 2013](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/revmodphys.85.1103).\n\n# What do we want from a QC ?\n\nIn a QC we would like to implement algorithms, which are based on well\ndefined operations. Influential examples of such algorithms are the\nquantum Fourier transform and the Grover algorithm.\n\nGiven that computations are typically implemented through logical truth\ntables, we typically base a quantum computer on qubits. We then call one\nstate $\\left|0\\right\\rangle$ and on\n$\\left|1\\right\\rangle$. Given that we would like to have\nreproducable computations, we always assume that we start them out with\nall qubits in the $\\left|0\\right\\rangle$ state.\n\nA computation consists then in applying a number of gates. The key is\nhere that any algorithm might be built up from an extremely limited\nnumber of gates. Typically four are sufficient:\n\n- The three gates that rotate each individual qubit on the Bloch\n  sphere.\n\n- A gate that entangles them properly. The standard example is here\n  the CNOT gate, which we will come back too.\n\nSuch computations are then typically nicely visualized through circuit\ndiagrams as used them already for the study of Bell inequalities and\nvisualized below.\n\n<figure id=\"fig-circuit\">\n<img src=\"./lecture20_pic1.png\" width=\"60%\" />\n<figcaption>A simple circuit diagram. It show the initial state, an entanglement\ngate, a number of single qubit gates and the final readout.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nAs atomic physics is only a minor part of the QC field, we typically\nhave to learn the new notations of the field again. As such single qubit\ngates are typically not explained through the Pauli matrices but by\ndifferent symbols like $H$ or $Z$. We come back to this later.\n\n## Some of the hopes for QCs\n\nThe major point to about a properly chosen set of gates is that it\nallows us to implement ANY algorithm. So they allow us to implement a\n_universal_ quantum computer. The main question is then how powerful\nsuch a QC would be. Could it solve problems as fast a a classical\ncomputer or maybe even faster ? This question is at the hard of the\nfield of complexity classes, which studies which kind of problem can be\nsolved [how efficiently](https://complexityzoo.uwaterloo.ca/Petting_Zoo).\n\nThe most fundamental question is then if a problem can be solved in a\npolynomial time (P hard) or not (NP-hard). Linear problems are P-hard\nand the travelling salesman problem is NP-hard. For some problems a\nquantum computer might then provide an answer in polynomial time, where\na classical computer would not\\... The factorization of prime numbers is\none of these problems as discussed in Shor algorithm.\n\nAnd the google paper that was published in 2019 actually indicated for\nthe first time that a quantum computer achieved such a task\n[Arute 2019](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1666-5).\n\n## Requirements for a QC\n\nGiven our excitement for a quantum computer, we might want a checklist\nof what we want from a quantum computer hardware. DiVincenzo proposed\n[the following ingredients](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physrep.2008.09.003):\n\n1.  Qubits that can store information in a scalable system.\n\n2.  The ability to initialize the system in the right state.\n\n3.  A universal set of gates.\n\n4.  Long coherence times, which are much longer than gate operation\n    times.\n\n5.  Good measurement capabilities\n\nTrapped ions allow us to fulfill all these requirements as we will see\nin this lecture and we will go through them step-by-step.\n\n# Trapping and cooling\n\nFor computing experiments one typically works with singe-charged ions\nlike $^{40}Ca^+$. Given their charge, they can be trapped in very clean\ntraps under vacuum. As such they are extremely well isolated from the\nenvironment and high precision experiments can be performed. Finally,\nthey have only one remain electron in the outer shell. Therefore they\nhave a hydrogenlike atomic structure.\n\nHowever, the trap construction is not trivial given Maxwells equation\n$\\text{div} \\vec{E} = 0$. So, the experimentalists have to play some\ntricks with oscillating fields. We will not derive in detail how a\nresulting **Paul trap** works, but the [linked\nvideo](https://youtu.be/Xb-zpM0UOzk) gives a very nice impression of the\nidea behind it.\n\nThis work on trapping ions dates back to the middle of the last century\n(!!!) and was recognized by the[ Nobel prize in\n1989](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1989/summary/) for\n[Wolfgang Paul](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/revmodphys.62.531) and [Hans Dehmelt](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/revmodphys.62.525). They shared\nthe prize with Norman Ramsey, who developped extremely precise\nspectroscopic methods, now known as [Ramsey spectroscopy](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/revmodphys.62.541).\n\n<figure id=\"fig-paul\">\n<img src=\"./lecture20_pic2.png\" width=\"60%\" />\n<figcaption>The two phases of the oscillating electric field of a Paul trap. Taken\nfrom¬†<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrupole_ion_trap\">wikipedia</a>.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<figure id=\"fig-paul-exp\">\n<img src=\"./lecture20_pic3.png\" width=\"60%\" />\n<figcaption>A linear ion (Paul) trap containing six calcium 40 ions. Taken\nfrom¬†<a href=\"https://quantumoptics.at/en/research/lintrap.html\">here</a>.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nA Paul trap provides a harmonic oscillator confinement with trapping\nfrequencies in the order of hundreds of kHz. An ion trapped in such a\ntrap can the be described by the Hamiltonian:\n\n$$\n\n\\hat{H}_{t} = \\frac{\\hat{p}^2}{2m}+ \\frac{m\\omega_t^2}{2}\\hat{x}^2\n$$\n\nThe two variables $p$ and $x$ are non-commuting $[x, p] = i\\hbar$, so\nthey cannot be measured at the same time. It can be nicely diagonalized\nin terms of the ladder operators:\n\n$$\n\\hat{x} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar}{2m\\omega_t}}\\left(\\hat{a}+\\hat{a}^\\dag\\right)\\\\\n\\hat{p} = i\\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar}{2m\\omega_t}}\\left(\\hat{a}^\\dag-\\hat{a}\\right)\\\\\n$$\n\nSo the Hamiltonian can now be written as:\n\n$$\n\\hat{H} = \\hbar \\omega_t \\left(\\hat{N} + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\text{ with } \\hat{N} = a^\\dag a\n$$\n\nHaving loaded the ions into the Paul trap we also need\nto cool them down.\n\n# Atom-light interaction\n\nGiven that the ions keep only on atom on the outer shell, they have a\nhydrogenlike structure, which makes\nthem optically well controllable. To control the ions further we use\nlight of amplitude $E_0$ and frequency $\\omega_L$:\n\n$$\n\\vec{E}(t) = \\vec{E}_0 \\cos(kx - \\omega_L t+\\varphi)\\\\\n= \\frac{\\vec{E}_0}{2} \\left(e^{i[kx - \\omega_lt+\\varphi]}+e^{-i[kx-\\omega_lt+\\varphi]}\\right)\n$$\n\nWe will describe the interal states of the ion for the\nmoment with the simple two state system of ground state\n$\\left|g\\right\\rangle$ and excited state\n$\\left|e\\right\\rangle$ at an energy $\\hbar \\omega_0$, which\nis typically in the order of thousands of THz. It has the Hamiltonian:\n\n$$\nH_{ion} = \\hbar \\omega_0 \\left|e\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle e\\right|\n$$\n\nPutting this ion into propagating light will induce a\ncoupling between these two internal states. As previously , we will\ndescribe the coupling in the semi-classical approximation through\n$H_\\textrm{int} = -\\hat{\\vec{D}} \\cdot \\vec{E}$. However, in this\ncontext we will not ignore the propagating nature of the light field and\nkeep its position dependence. This is necessary as we would like to\nunderstand how the light influences the movement of the atoms and not\nonly the internal states. Putting them together we obtain:\n\n$$\nH_\\textrm{int} = \\frac{\\Omega}{2}\\left([\\left|g\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle e\\right|+\\left|e\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle g\\right|]e^{i(k \\hat{x} - \\omega_L t+\\varphi)} + h.c.\\right)\n$$\n\nThe laser frequency is tuned closely to the frequency of\nthe internal state transition and we will be only interested in the\ndetuning $\\Delta = \\omega_0 - \\omega_L$. Importantly, it couples the\nposition of the atom and the internal states.\n\nTo simplify the problem, we can work in the rotating frame to describe\nthe external and internal degrees of freedom for the ion:\n\n$$\n\n\\hat{H}= \\hbar \\omega_t \\hat{a}^\\dag \\hat{a} + \\hbar\\Delta \\left|e\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle e\\right| + \\frac{\\Omega}{2}\\left(\\left|e\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle g\\right|e^{i\\left(k \\hat{x}+\\varphi\\right)} + h.c.\\right)\n$$\n\nWe will now see how this system is used to cool the ions to the motional\ngroundstate, perform single qubit operations and then two-qubit\noperations.\n\n# Doppler cooling\n\nThis interaction of the atom with a photon is at the origin of the\nall-important Laser cooling, which was pioneered for ions in the 1970s\n(!!) by the Wineland group. For cooling transition we couple the ground\nstate to an excited state of finitie lifetime $\\tau= \\frac{1}{\\Gamma}$.\n\n<figure id=\"fig-laser-cooling\">\n<img src=\"./lecture20_pic2.png\" width=\"60%\" />\n</figure>\n\nThe basic idea of laser cooling. The incoming light gives the ion a\nmomentum kick¬†$\\vec{k}_{in}$. The photon is reemitted in a random\ndirection such that¬†$<\\vec{k}_{out}>=0$.\n\nThis laser cooling had a tremendous impact on the field of atomic\nphysics in general. Notably it gave rise to the field of cold atoms to\nwhich we will get back in the next lecture. This importance was\nrecognized in the Nobel prizes of 1997 for [Steve Chu](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/revmodphys.70.685), [Claude\nCohen-Tannoudji](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/revmodphys.70.707) and [Bill Phillips](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/revmodphys.70.721).\n\n## Working in the Lamb-Dicke regime\n\nAfter this initial cooling stage the atoms have to be cooled to the\nground state in the trap. To treat the trapped particles we will express\nthe position operator in terms of the ladder operator, such that:\n\n$$\nk\\hat{x} = \\eta (\\hat{a}^\\dag+ \\hat{a})\\\\\n\\eta = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2/2m}{\\hbar \\omega_t}} =\\sqrt{\\frac{E_R}{\\hbar \\omega_t}}\n$$\n\n$\\eta$ is called the _Lamb-Dicke_ parameter. It compares\nthe change in motional energy due to the absorption of the photon\n$E_r = \\frac{(\\hbar k)^2}{2m}$ compared to the energy spacing\n$\\hbar \\omega_t$ in the trap. When it is small it suppresses the change\nof the motional state of the atom due to the absorption of a photon.\n\nFor simplicity we will set in this section $\\varphi=0$ and develop the\nexponent to obtain:\n\n$$\nH_\\textrm{int} = \\frac{\\Omega}{2}\\left(\\left|e\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle g\\right|\\left(1 + i\\eta[\\hat{a}^\\dag+ \\hat{a}]\\right) + h.c.\\right)\n$$\n\nSo it contains three couplings for different trap levels\nand internal states:\n\n- The _carrier_ transition\n  $\\left|g,n\\right\\rangle\\rightarrow \\left|e,n\\right\\rangle$\n  with strength $\\Omega$.\n\n- The _red_ sideband\n  $\\left|g,n\\right\\rangle\\rightarrow \\left|e,n-1\\right\\rangle$\n  with strength $\\eta \\Omega(n+1)$. It leads to a reduction of the\n  trap level and it is resonant for $\\Delta = -\\omega_t$.\n\n- The _blue_ sideband\n  $\\left|g,n\\right\\rangle\\rightarrow \\left|e,n+1\\right\\rangle$\n  with strength $\\eta \\Omega n$. It leads to an increase of the trap\n  level and it is resonant for $\\Delta = \\omega_t$.\n\nThe full energy diagram is summarized in the figure below.\n\n<figure id=\"fig-paul-exp\">\n<img src=\"./lecture20_pic5.png\" width=\"60%\" />\n<figcaption>Level structure of an two-level system coupled to a laser field as\ndiscussed in the text.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThis scheme is used to perform **Raman side-band cooling**. The laser is\ntuned on the transition\n$\\left|n,g\\right\\rangle\\rightarrow \\left|n-1,e\\right\\rangle$\nsuch that each absorption involves a reduction in the trap level. This\nset-up for cooling was first demonstrated in [1995 by the Wineland group](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/physrevlett.75.4011).\n\nIt is at this stage that the ions are in the motional ground state and\nwe can focus our attention to the high control of the internal qubit\nstates of the ion for quantum computing.\n\n# Single-qubit operations\n\nThe single qubit operations can now be identified with the transition\n$\\left|e,n\\right\\rangle\\leftrightarrow \\left|g,n\\right\\rangle$.\nWe can then simplify the atom-light interaction too:\n\n$$\n\\hat{H}= \\hbar\\Delta \\left|e\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle e\\right| + \\frac{\\hbar\\Omega}{2}\\left(\\left|e\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle g\\right|e^{i\\varphi} +\\left|g\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle e\\right|e^{-i\\varphi}\\right)\n$$\n\nWe can translate this into the language of qubit\noperations through the definitions:\n\n$$\n\\sigma_z = \\frac{\\left|e\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle e\\right|-\\left|g\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle g\\right|}{2}\\\\\n\\sigma_x = \\frac{\\left|e\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle g\\right|+\\left|g\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle e\\right|}{2}\\\\\n\\sigma_y = \\frac{i\\left|e\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle g\\right|-i\\left|g\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle e\\right|}{2}\n$$\n\nSo we can now simply write the Hamiltonian as:\n\n$$\n\\hat{H}= \\hbar\\Delta \\sigma_z +\\Omega_x \\sigma_x +\\Omega_y \\sigma_y\\\\\n\\Omega_x = \\Omega \\cos(\\varphi)\\\\\n\\Omega_y = \\Omega \\sin(\\varphi)\n$$\n\nIn the QC community people rarely talk about the Pauli matrices, but\nmuch rather about a few specific gates. The most cited here is the\n_Hadamard_ gate, which transforms\n$\\left|0/1\\right\\rangle\\rightarrow \\frac{\\left|0\\right\\rangle\\pm\\left|1\\right\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\nSo it has no good classical analog. Further a double application brings\nus back to the origin.\n\nThe other gate we named about was a Z gate, which is simply a $\\pi$\nrotation around the z axis.\n\n# Two-qubit operations\n\nTo implement a quantum computer the system has to be completed by a\ntwo-qubit operation. For ions a number of two-qubit gates exist as\ndiscussed nicely in [Sec. 2.6 of Haffner 2008](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physrep.2008.09.003):\n\n- The **Cirac-Zoller** gate was the [first proposed two-qubit gate](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/physrevlett.74.4091)\n  [@Cirac_1995] and it was also the first one realized [within the same\n  year](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/physrevlett.75.4714).\n\n- The **Soerensen-Moelmer** gate was [proposed later](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/physrevlett.82.1971),\n  but it is extremely important from a practical point of view as it\n  leads to very high entanglement fidelities.\n\n- Another realization, which we mention for completeness is the\n  geometric phase-gate, which is used [in the NIST group](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature01492).\n\nWe will now discuss a bit the Soerensen-Moelmer gate, which is nicely\ndescribed [here](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/physreva.62.022311). In this set-up two ions sit in a\ncommon trap. The cost of energy for exciting one of the ions will be\nlabelled $\\omega_t$ as in the first section. So we assume that the\nscheme starts in the state $\\left|ggn\\right\\rangle$, where\nboth atoms are in the internal ground-state $g$ and in some excited trap\nlevel $n$.\n\nIn the next step, these two ions experience two lasers, which are\ncoupling excited and the ground state of the ions:\n\n- One laser has frequency $\\omega_1=\\omega_0-\\omega_t+\\delta$ and Rabi\n  coupling strength $\\Omega$. It is therefore only slightly detuned\n  from the transitions\n  $|ggn\\rangle\\rightarrow|eg,n-1\\rangle |ge,n-1\\rangle$.\n\n- The second laser has frequency $\\omega_2=\\omega_0+\\omega_t-\\delta$\n  and Rabi coupling strength $\\Omega$. It is therefore only slightly\n  detuned from the transitions\n  $|ggn\\rangle\\rightarrow|eg,n+1\\rangle |ge,n+1\\rangle$.\n\nThe resulting level diagram is depicted below.\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"./lecture20_pic6.png\" width=\"60%\" />\n<figcaption>Level scheme of the Sorensen Moelmer gate as described in the text.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThe gate is then operated in the regime of small coupling strength\n$\\eta \\Omega n \\ll \\delta$. In this case coupling to the excited\nmotional states $n\\pm 1$ is suppressed by a factor of\n$\\frac{\\eta \\Omega n}{\\delta}$. On the other hand we are exactly on\nresonance for the two-photon transitions\n$|ggn\\rangle\\rightarrow|eg,n+1\\rangle\\rightarrow|ee,n\\rangle$ etc. So we\ncan do second-order pertubation theory to obtain the\neffective Hamiltonian:\n\n$$\nH_\\mathrm{SM} = \\frac{\\Omega_\\mathrm{SL}}{2}\\left(\\left|ggn\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle een\\right| + (\\left|een\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle ggn\\right|\\right)\\text{ with }\\Omega_{SL} = -\\frac{(\\Omega \\eta)^2}{2(\\eta - \\delta)}\n$$\n\nSo starting out with the state\n$\\left|gg\\right\\rangle$ and applying the laser for\n$t\\Omega =\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, we obtain the entangled state that we are\nlooking for.\n\nThe operation of the gate was first demonstrated in 2000 by the Wineland\ngroup and allowed at the time for generating a Bell state [with a\nfidelity of 83%](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/35005011). This limit has been increasingly pushed\nof the years and now [reaches the 99.9% region](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/physrevlett.117.060504).\n\nSuch a fidelity sounds very impressive on first sight and it is by now\nthe result of several decades of work. However, in a quantum computer we\nwould like to chain a large number of these gates behind each other.\n\n- After 10 iterations the fidelity dropped to 99%.\n\n- After 100 iterations the fidelity dropped to 90%.\n\n- After 1000 iterations the fidelity dropped to 30%.\n\nSo even with such an excellent fidelity it will barely be possible to\nchain much more than 100 gates before the some extremely iffy things\nstart to happen.\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"./lecture20_pic7.png\" width=\"60%\" />\n<figcaption>From the iSWAP to the CNOT gate.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nSo we have experimentally the choice of entanglement tool in the way\nthat is most adapted to our work.\n\n# Practical considerations\n\nA commonly used ion is $\\mathrm{Ca+} \\, (Z=20)$. The level scheme of the calcium atom is shown below. The different\ntransitions are used for different purposes:\n\n- The broad transition at 397nm is used for cooling.\n\n- Coupling between the qubit states is performed through the 729nm\n  transition.\n\n- The 866nm and the 854nm are used for pumping the atoms into\n  appropiate substates.\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"./lecture20_pic8.png\" width=\"60%\" />\n<figcaption>The level scheme of the calcium atom. The arrows indicate transitions\nby absorption and emission of photons. A qubit can be realized by\nchoosing the ground state and an excited state. Taken\nfrom <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1367-2630/15/12/123012\">here</a>.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nSeveral solutions for scaling up the quantum computing architecture are\nunder way .¬†*Long ion chains* in linear Paul traps with up to 40\nions are the current 'work-horse'. This is the 'simplest' existing\narchitecture. In such a geometry Shors algorithm was [shown for the\nnumber 15](http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.aad9480) with five qubits and entanglement between up to\n[14 qubits was studied](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/physrevlett.106.130506). However, it reaches its natural\nlimits for entangling distant ions due to cross-talk with other ions\nduring the operation. Therefore, different approaches are currently\ntested to scale the architecture to larger [fault-tolerant geometries](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/physrevx.7.041061).\n\nBy no means we will be able to give a full picture of the booming field.\nHowever, a few main players are:\n\n- NIST, JQI and IonQ, which are all strongly connected through their\n  shared past with Dave Wineland.\n\n- Innsbruck,¬† Mainz and AQT which are connected through their shared\n  past and present with Rainer Blatt.\n\n- ETH, Oxford, ...\n\n- The AQTION and the MicroQC network, which are part of the European\n  flagship initiative.\n\n[^1]:\n    Philipp Hauke worked a lot with them. Fred is an AMO person and\n    Ferdinand Schmidt-Kaler was kind enough to provide a lot of\n    background information on the experiments",
