In the last few weeks I kept wondering quite a bit about the association between democratic governance and nation-states. In the current environment your passport tells you where you can vote. But what if the decisions that shape your life—your climate, your data, your economic future—are made by governments you can't vote for? This is the paradox of modern democracy and in this blog post I decide to dive into different models, federations, conferations and cosmopolitan democracy that attempt to solve it.

And as for other economic or political topics, I really like to explore it from the personal perspective of some fictional characters. So time to get started:

## A ferry lounge at 2 AM

We are in the ferry's lounge on the ferry from Barcelona to Tunis. It is nearly empty—just Amara, a sleeping truck driver in the corner, the humming coffee machine, and two other insomniacs she hasn't noticed yet.

Amara spreads her research across two tables: water level charts from the Medjerda basin, extraction data from three countries, meeting notes from Barcelona that led 
nowhere. European agricultural policies, Libyan water extraction, and Algerian dam 
construction all determine whether her region has sustainable water—yet she can 
vote in none of these jurisdictions.

Two tables away its Sofia, a seasoned member of the EU commision. She tries to focus on her own Tunisia briefing notes. But she 
keeps glancing at Amara's charts—the basin maps, the extraction data, the obvious 
frustration. She recognizes that frustration.

Near the window, Adam curses quietly at his laptop. Three different regulatory 
frameworks, three incompatible requirements, one AI model. He reaches for coffee 
and notices the two women surrounded by governance documents. He's not the only 
one having jurisdiction problems tonight.

### Amara's confederal trap

Amara has spent years studying transboundary water governance, trying to understand why the system fails her region. From those studies she learns that shared water resources are governed through a [confederation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederation) — a loose association of sovereign states that cooperate voluntarily. The United Nations water conventions, Mediterranean water partnerships, bilateral treaties: all confederations.

In a confederation, member states keep their independence but sign treaties to act together on specific topics. The key institutional feature is that states retain full sovereignty—decisions require consensus, there are no binding enforcement mechanisms, and citizens participate only through their national governments.

Water governance conferences illustrate this: neighboring countries produce agreements with no binding enforcement mechanisms. Summits produce commitments, countries pursue national interests, aquifers continue depleting—and communities like Amara's keep losing water. The Mediterranean water framework set cooperative targets, but when countries exceed extraction limits, there are no penalties beyond diplomatic complaints.

### Key characteristics

Confederations share four institutional features: **sovereignty preservation** (unanimous voting, withdrawal rights), **functional minimalism** (limited to what treaties explicitly authorize), **no hierarchy** (states as equal sovereigns, not subjects of higher authority), and **indirect representation** (Amara participates only through her national government, never directly).

They also lack strong normative foundations. Confederate treaties define narrow goals—mutual defense, trade coordination—without establishing binding universal rights. When principles appear (like the UN Declaration of Human Rights), they're aspirational and weakly enforced. Sovereignty always trumps shared values—or survival.

The result: weak enforcement, minimal democratic participation, fragmented governance. This is why Amara watches the ocean rise while having no democratic recourse.

Sofia has been sitting two tables away, trying to work on her own briefing notes 
for the Tunisia meetings. But she keeps glancing at Amara's charts—the basin maps, 
the extraction data, the obvious frustration in how Amara reorganizes the same 
papers repeatedly.

She recognizes that frustration. She's felt it in every EU climate negotiation.

"Transboundary water governance?" Sofia asks, moving to the adjacent table.

Amara looks up, surprised someone knows what she's looking at. "The kind that 
doesn't work. You're familiar with it?"

"Different domain, same problem," Sofia says. "Twenty-seven countries, climate 
policy, unanimous consent required. I work for the EU."

## The federal model—and Sofia's experience

### What is a federation?

What Sofia knows from Brussels is that the EU represents the world's most ambitious attempt at federal governance beyond the nation-state. A [federation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalism) differs fundamentally from confederation: it creates binding supranational authority. Germany, the United States, and the EU all share this structure — multiple levels of government with the higher level having enforcement power.

In a federation, federal law supersedes member state law. There's a shared constitution, binding courts, and citizens vote in both national and federal elections. The EU demonstrates this: European regulations become law across all member states, the European Court of Justice can overrule national courts, and citizens elect the European Parliament directly.

Sofia's daily work operates within this federal structure: EU climate regulations have legal force, the Emissions Trading System binds all members, and enforcement mechanisms exist that confederations lack. Unlike climate conferences where Amara watches countries make voluntary pledges, Sofia works in a system where decisions become binding law.

### Key characteristics of federations

Federations rest on institutional features that solve confederation's problems: **hierarchical authority** (federal law supersedes state law), **territorial subsidiarity** (decisions at appropriate levels, but within nested territories), **dual legitimacy** (citizens vote at both levels), and **constitutional unity** (shared legal framework with binding courts).

They also embody strong normative foundations. Federal constitutions establish universal rights that apply to all citizens—Germany's Basic Law, the US Bill of Rights. They create redistribution mechanisms ensuring minimum standards across regions. They distinguish sharply between insiders (citizens with full rights) and outsiders.

This federal structure gives Sofia tools Amara lacks: binding regulations, enforcement mechanisms, supranational courts, and democratic participation in institutions that wield real power.

### Sofia's reality: federal power and federal gridlock

Yet Sofia had just closed her laptop after another failed climate negotiation when she saw Amara's conference paper. The EU has binding power, but that doesn't mean it works smoothly.

Twenty-seven countries, twenty-seven veto points. Even among democracies with similar values and roughly comparable economic systems, consensus proves extraordinarily difficult. Climate policy requires balancing Polish coal interests, German industrial concerns, French nuclear preferences, and Nordic renewable ambitions—all within a single legal framework.

The federal model works within relatively bounded cultural and political contexts. The EU, operating among twenty-seven relatively similar states, already faces severe difficulties achieving consensus and maintaining democratic legitimacy. Sofia sees this daily: the formal power exists, but practical politics create gridlock.

### The scale problem

After Sofia's presentation, Amara understands the challenge: scaling federal governance to 198 countries with fundamentally incompatible political systems presents a different magnitude of problem. The world includes liberal democracies, authoritarian states, theocracies, and hybrid regimes. Could China and the US share a constitution? Would Russia and the EU accept the same legal framework? Could India and Pakistan agree on a federal judiciary?

Multiplying the EU's complexity by seven—and adding nuclear weapons and fundamental ideological conflicts—suggests the obstacles to world federalism are not merely practical but structural. The federal model works within culturally relatively homogeneous boundaries. But the world exceeds those boundaries substantially.

After they share their analyses, both Amara and Sofia realize neither confederation nor federation solves the problem. Confederation leaves affected populations without democratic recourse. Federation offers binding power but cannot scale to global diversity.

## Cosmopolitan democracy: Overlapping networks

Over coffee, Adam joins their conversation. He's been facing similar frustrations with digital governance—but from a different angle.

"Your models assume governance happens in territorial boxes," Adam says. "But consider my work on AI models: European regulators want to audit it. American platforms host it. Singaporean authorities monitor it. Meanwhile, the open-source community that actually built the underlying framework has its own governance processes—completely separate from any government."

He continues: "Then there's the data. It flows across jurisdictions instantly. Some is governed by GDPR in Europe, some by different rules in California, some by Chinese data sovereignty laws, and some exists in regulatory grey zones. Multiple authorities, overlapping jurisdictions, no clear hierarchy."

Amara recognizes the pattern: "That's exactly what I experience with climate. Emissions come from everywhere, impacts hit everywhere, and governance is fragmented across states, corporations, NGOs, cities—all with different authorities that overlap and intersect."

Sofia nods: "And in the EU, we see this even within our federal structure. Climate policy involves the Commission, member states, regional governments, cities, private companies, and civil society organizations—all with different roles and authorities that don't fit neatly into a hierarchy."

They're all describing the overlapping networks of power that led David Held to work on cosmopolitan democracy (CD). It captures exactly this reality: the global order consists of multiple and overlapping networks of power involving the body, welfare, culture, civic associations, the economy, coercive relations and organized violence, and regulatory and legal relations. The case for cosmopolitan democracy arises from these diverse networks—the different power systems which constitute the interconnections of different peoples and nations.

### Why overlapping networks matter

This network perspective differs fundamentally from both confederation and federation. Confederations assume states are the primary actors, cooperating voluntarily. Federations assume nested territorial hierarchies with clear authority levels. But reality—as Amara, Sofia, and Adam all experience—operates through overlapping functional networks that don't respect these boundaries.

Climate governance involves states, but also corporations setting emissions targets, cities forming climate alliances, NGOs monitoring compliance, and scientific bodies establishing standards. Digital governance involves states, but also platform companies making content rules, standards bodies setting protocols, open-source communities building infrastructure, and users forming governance communities.

These networks don't fit into territorial boxes. They overlap, intersect, and operate at multiple scales simultaneously. An AI safety standard might be developed by a technical community, adopted by a platform company, endorsed by an international body, and enforced (or not) by national regulators—with affected users having input at various points but no single "citizenship" that grants them comprehensive democratic participation.

This is the puzzle cosmopolitan democracy attempts to solve: how to create democratic governance structures that match these overlapping networks of actual power and influence.

## The Institutional Design: How do you govern overlapping networks?

Once you accept this network-based view of global governance, the next question becomes practical: how do you actually implement democratic governance across these overlapping systems? Over the following days, Amara, Sofia, and Adam study Held's framework together. They identify two core institutional mechanisms that could address their shared frustrations.

### Institutional Principle 1 - Multi-level democratic law-making

Definition according to the book (feature 4 of CD in the book):

> Law-making and law enforcement can be developed within this framework at a variety of locations and levels, along with an expansion of the influence of regional and international courts to monitor and check political and social authority.

This feature means that laws are not made and enforced only by national governments. Instead, rules and courts exist at many levels at the same time—local, national, regional, and global—and they work together. Different layers of authority can create and enforce laws, and higher-level courts can step in when lower levels violate rights or abuse power. In simple terms: power is shared across many levels, and multiple courts ensure everyone plays by the rules.

This addresses Adam's regulatory gap problem directly—rules would exist at every level where power actually operates, preventing the jurisdiction shopping that currently plagues digital governance.

### Institutional Principle 2 - Nested citizenship

The definition from the book:

> People can enjoy membership in the diverse communities which significantly affect them and, accordingly, access to a variety of form: of political participation. Citizenship would be extended, in principle to membership in all cross-cutting political communities, from the local to the global.

This feature means that people are not limited to belonging politically to just one community (usually the nation-state). Instead, they can be citizens in many overlapping communities at once—their city, their region, their country, and also transnational or global bodies that affect their lives. Each level gives them political rights and ways to participate. In simple terms: your political voice follows the real-life sources of power that shape your world, no matter where they sit geographically.

For Amara, this means citizenship not just in the Maldives, but in the climate system itself—democratic membership in the institutions that govern the emissions drowning her homeland. For Adam, it means recognized political standing in the digital governance networks that currently treat him as either a passive subject or an ungoverned actor.

In a federation, people typically have dual citizenship (state + federal), but political participation is still bound to the territorial units of the federation; cross-border or global political membership is not recognized. In a confederation, citizenship remains almost entirely national, and political participation at the confederal level is usually indirect (through governments, not individuals). Cosmopolitan democracy goes further by giving individuals direct political membership in multiple overlapping communities, including global ones. This creates a model where political belonging follows functional interdependence—not just territorial borders—something federations and confederations do only partially or not at all.

### Institutional design principles applied to climate change

For Amara, these two principles translate into concrete possibilities. Multi-level law-making would mean binding climate rules legislated and enforced across local, national, regional, and global levels—with courts able to hold states and corporations accountable when their emissions violate others' rights. The current voluntary pledge system that fails the Maldives would be replaced by enforceable obligations at every governance level.

Nested citizenship would give Amara direct political membership in climate governance institutions. Not just representation through the Maldivian government at climate conferences, but actual citizenship rights in a global climate authority—the ability to vote, deliberate, and hold decision-makers accountable in the very institutions that determine whether her homeland survives. She would be a citizen of the climate system, with democratic standing wherever climate decisions are made.

Together, these principles create a governance system that matches the transboundary nature of climate itself. Amara gains democratic voice not where she was born, but where the power affecting her survival actually operates.

### Institutional design principles applied to digital governance

For Adam, the same principles offer solutions to his regulatory fragmentation. Multi-level law-making would close the gaps he currently navigates: digital rights and AI rules enacted and enforced across local, regional, and global institutions—preventing the jurisdiction shopping that lets platforms exploit regulatory arbitrage. His AI model would face coherent rules at every level where it operates, rather than conflicting requirements from authorities that don't coordinate.

Nested citizenship would give Adam—and the millions his systems affect—democratic membership in digital governance bodies. Not passive subjection to terms of service he didn't write, or regulatory regimes he can't influence, but actual citizenship rights: participation in platform rule-making, voting rights in regional data authorities, democratic standing in global AI oversight institutions. Users would become citizens of the digital systems that govern their data, their algorithms, their digital lives.

Sofia sees how this differs from the EU's federal model: instead of trying to create a single territorial authority over digital systems that inherently transcend borders, cosmopolitan democracy creates democratic membership in the overlapping functional networks where digital power actually operates. The governance structure matches the technology's actual architecture.

## The Normative Foundation: Rights, not just rules

"The institutional design tells us *how* to govern," Sofia observes. "But what 
principles should guide these institutions?"

Held's framework rests on five normative principles that distinguish cosmopolitan 
democracy from both the voluntarism of confederations and the territorial limits 
of federations.

### Core Rights Framework

**Cosmopolitan law** establishes universal rights—health, social welfare, culture, 
civic participation, economy, peace, politics—that apply everywhere, regardless of 
nationality. For Amara, this means climate stability becomes a legally enforceable 
right, not a diplomatic aspiration. For Adam, digital rights—privacy, data protection, 
algorithmic transparency—gain enforceable status across all jurisdictions.

**Universal constitutional principles** create red lines no actor may cross: no mass 
surveillance, no environmental destruction that violates others' survival, no 
concentration of power that undermines democratic participation. These are 
constitutional-level constraints, not voluntary guidelines.

### Democratic Imperatives

**Global civic commitment** requires actively supporting those excluded from democratic 
participation. Climate finance for vulnerable populations isn't charity—it's a 
democratic obligation ensuring equal political agency. Digital inclusion for those 
harmed by algorithmic bias follows the same logic.

**Cosmopolitan social justice** demands that economic activity—whether carbon emissions 
or data extraction—support rather than undermine democratic equality. High emitters 
bear greater climate responsibilities; digital monopolies that concentrate power 
violate this principle directly.

**Non-coercive relations** govern dispute resolution through courts and mediation, with 
collective force permitted only as last resort to defend democratic rights.

Together, these principles create normative foundations that confederations lack and 
federations apply only within borders—cosmopolitan democracy extends them globally.

### What this means for Amara's climate challenge

For Amara, these principles transform her democratic powerlessness into actionable rights. Climate stability becomes legally enforceable—not diplomatic aspiration. Excessive emissions from Shanghai, Houston, or Frankfurt violate her autonomy and trigger legal accountability. Constitutional minimums establish that climate harm isn't a policy preference but a rights violation.

The civic commitment principle demands urgent support for vulnerable populations: climate finance, adaptation measures, guaranteed participation in decision-making. Not charity—democratic obligation. High emitters bear greater responsibilities; the Maldives receives protections tied to equal political agency.

Disputes go to climate courts and mediation, not power politics. Amara gains standing in institutions governing the emissions drowning her homeland.

### What this means for Adam's digital governance problem

For Adam, cosmopolitan law makes digital rights—privacy, data protection, algorithmic transparency—enforceable across all jurisdictions where his AI operates. No more regulatory arbitrage. Constitutional principles create binding limits: no mass surveillance, no opaque manipulation, no discrimination encoded in systems.

The civic commitment requires including those currently excluded: users harmed by algorithmic bias, populations lacking connectivity, communities subject to unilateral corporate control. Digital monopolies that concentrate power violate social justice principles directly—data and compute infrastructure must be governed to empower, not marginalize.

Digital disputes—between platforms, regulators, users—go to international courts and coordinated mechanisms, not cyberwarfare or unilateral retaliation. Adam and the millions his systems affect gain democratic standing in the governance networks that currently treat them as passive subjects.

## Conclusion

* **Cosmopolitan democracy = normatively federal, structurally confederal, but ontologically post-sovereign.**
* It borrows from **federalism** the *constitutionalism*, *rights framework*, and *direct citizenship*.
* It borrows from **confederalism** the *plurality*, *voluntary coordination*, and *respect for local autonomy*.
* But it ultimately **transcends both** by grounding authority in *universal personhood* rather than *member units*.
