In the last few weeks I kept wondering quite a bit about the association between democratic governance and nation-states. In the current environment your passport tells you where you can vote. But what if the decisions that shape your life—your climate, your data, your economic future—are made by governments you can't vote for? This is the paradox of modern democracy and in this blog post I decide to dive into different models, federations, conferations and cosmopolitan democracy that attempt to solve it.

And as for other economic or political topics, I really like to explore it from the personal perspective of some fictional characters. So here they are:

## The characters: Three People, One common problem

**Malé, Maldives**
Amara watches the ocean from her balcony. In 50 years, this view will be 
underwater. The carbon emissions drowning her country come from Beijing, 
Houston, and Frankfurt—places where she has no vote, no voice, no say.

**Singapore**
Adam deploys his latest AI model. European regulators want to audit his code. 
American platforms host it. Singaporean authorities monitor it. He's built something 
that exists everywhere and nowhere—governed by everyone and no one.

**Brussels, Belgium**
Sofia closes her laptop after another failed climate negotiation. Twenty-seven 
countries, twenty-seven veto points. "We need unanimous consent," her colleague 
sighs. "Which means we need a miracle."

Three people. Three continents. One problem: **They have the deeply seeded feeling that democracy wasn't built for their current problems.**

## The confederal model

### What is a confederation?

Consider Amara's situation: she cannot vote in Shanghai, Houston, or Frankfurt—yet decisions there determine whether her homeland survives. This isn't a flaw in democracy; it's a feature of how global governance is structured.

Amara has been studying global climate governance, trying to understand why the system fails her homeland. In Brussels, Sofia has been writing a report on EU climate policy effectiveness. They don't know it yet, but they're analyzing opposite sides of the same problem.

The global order is not a government. It's a [confederation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederation)—a loose association of sovereign states that cooperate voluntarily. The United Nations, NATO, the Paris Climate Agreement: all confederations.

In a confederation, member states keep their independence but sign treaties to act together on specific topics. The key institutional feature is that states retain full sovereignty—decisions require consensus, there are no binding enforcement mechanisms, and citizens participate only through their national governments.

Climate conferences illustrate this: 198 countries produce agreements with no binding consequences for non-compliance. Summits produce commitments, countries pursue national interests, emissions continue rising—and the Maldives continues sinking. The Paris Agreement set ambitious targets, but when countries miss them, there are no penalties beyond diplomatic pressure.

This structure creates Amara's democratic disconnect: The factories in Shanghai, American fossil fuel policies, and EU climate decisions all impact whether her homeland remains habitable—yet she can vote in none of these jurisdictions. Decisions affecting her survival are made by governments she cannot influence democratically.

### Key characteristics

Confederations share four institutional features: **sovereignty preservation** (unanimous voting, withdrawal rights), **functional minimalism** (limited to what treaties explicitly authorize), **no hierarchy** (states as equal sovereigns, not subjects of higher authority), and **indirect representation** (Amara participates only through her national government, never directly).

They also lack strong normative foundations. Confederate treaties define narrow goals—mutual defense, trade coordination—without establishing binding universal rights. When principles appear (like the UN Declaration of Human Rights), they're aspirational and weakly enforced. Sovereignty always trumps shared values—or survival.

The result: weak enforcement, minimal democratic participation, fragmented governance. This is why Amara watches the ocean rise while having no democratic recourse. When she presents her analysis at a climate policy conference in Geneva, Sofia is in the audience. After the panel, Sofia approaches: "I work on the federal alternative you mentioned. But I think you should know—it's not the solution you're hoping for."

## The federal model—and Sofia's experience

### What is a federation?

What Sofia knows from Brussels is that the EU represents the world's most ambitious attempt at federal governance beyond the nation-state. A [federation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalism) differs fundamentally from confederation: it creates binding supranational authority. Germany, the United States, and the EU all share this structure — multiple levels of government with the higher level having enforcement power.

In a federation, federal law supersedes member state law. There's a shared constitution, binding courts, and citizens vote in both national and federal elections. The EU demonstrates this: European regulations become law across all member states, the European Court of Justice can overrule national courts, and citizens elect the European Parliament directly.

Sofia's daily work operates within this federal structure: EU climate regulations have legal force, the Emissions Trading System binds all members, and enforcement mechanisms exist that confederations lack. Unlike climate conferences where Amara watches countries make voluntary pledges, Sofia works in a system where decisions become binding law.

### Key characteristics of federations

Federations rest on institutional features that solve confederation's problems: **hierarchical authority** (federal law supersedes state law), **territorial subsidiarity** (decisions at appropriate levels, but within nested territories), **dual legitimacy** (citizens vote at both levels), and **constitutional unity** (shared legal framework with binding courts).

They also embody strong normative foundations. Federal constitutions establish universal rights that apply to all citizens—Germany's Basic Law, the US Bill of Rights. They create redistribution mechanisms ensuring minimum standards across regions. They distinguish sharply between insiders (citizens with full rights) and outsiders.

This federal structure gives Sofia tools Amara lacks: binding regulations, enforcement mechanisms, supranational courts, and democratic participation in institutions that wield real power.

### Sofia's reality: federal power and federal gridlock

Yet Sofia had just closed her laptop after another failed climate negotiation when she saw Amara's conference paper. The EU has binding power, but that doesn't mean it works smoothly.

Twenty-seven countries, twenty-seven veto points. Even among democracies with similar values and roughly comparable economic systems, consensus proves extraordinarily difficult. Climate policy requires balancing Polish coal interests, German industrial concerns, French nuclear preferences, and Nordic renewable ambitions—all within a single legal framework.

The federal model works within relatively bounded cultural and political contexts. The EU, operating among twenty-seven relatively similar states, already faces severe difficulties achieving consensus and maintaining democratic legitimacy. Sofia sees this daily: the formal power exists, but practical politics create gridlock.

### The scale problem

After Sofia's presentation, Amara understands the challenge: scaling federal governance to 198 countries with fundamentally incompatible political systems presents a different magnitude of problem. The world includes liberal democracies, authoritarian states, theocracies, and hybrid regimes. Could China and the US share a constitution? Would Russia and the EU accept the same legal framework? Could India and Pakistan agree on a federal judiciary?

Multiplying the EU's complexity by seven—and adding nuclear weapons and fundamental ideological conflicts—suggests the obstacles to world federalism are not merely practical but structural. The federal model works within culturally relatively homogeneous boundaries. But the world exceeds those boundaries substantially.

After they share their analyses, both Amara and Sofia realize neither confederation nor federation solves the problem. Confederation leaves affected populations without democratic recourse. Federation offers binding power but cannot scale to global diversity.

## Cosmopolitan democracy: Overlapping networks

Over coffee, Adam joins their conversation. He's been facing similar frustrations with digital governance—but from a different angle.

"Your models assume governance happens in territorial boxes," Adam says. "But consider my work on AI models: European regulators want to audit it. American platforms host it. Singaporean authorities monitor it. Meanwhile, the open-source community that actually built the underlying framework has its own governance processes—completely separate from any government."

He continues: "Then there's the data. It flows across jurisdictions instantly. Some is governed by GDPR in Europe, some by different rules in California, some by Chinese data sovereignty laws, and some exists in regulatory grey zones. Multiple authorities, overlapping jurisdictions, no clear hierarchy."

Amara recognizes the pattern: "That's exactly what I experience with climate. Emissions come from everywhere, impacts hit everywhere, and governance is fragmented across states, corporations, NGOs, cities—all with different authorities that overlap and intersect."

Sofia nods: "And in the EU, we see this even within our federal structure. Climate policy involves the Commission, member states, regional governments, cities, private companies, and civil society organizations—all with different roles and authorities that don't fit neatly into a hierarchy."

They're all describing the overlapping networks of power that led David Held to work on cosmopolitan democracy (CD). It captures exactly this reality: the global order consists of multiple and overlapping networks of power involving the body, welfare, culture, civic associations, the economy, coercive relations and organized violence, and regulatory and legal relations. The case for cosmopolitan democracy arises from these diverse networks—the different power systems which constitute the interconnections of different peoples and nations.

### Why overlapping networks matter

This network perspective differs fundamentally from both confederation and federation. Confederations assume states are the primary actors, cooperating voluntarily. Federations assume nested territorial hierarchies with clear authority levels. But reality—as Amara, Sofia, and Adam all experience—operates through overlapping functional networks that don't respect these boundaries.

Climate governance involves states, but also corporations setting emissions targets, cities forming climate alliances, NGOs monitoring compliance, and scientific bodies establishing standards. Digital governance involves states, but also platform companies making content rules, standards bodies setting protocols, open-source communities building infrastructure, and users forming governance communities.

These networks don't fit into territorial boxes. They overlap, intersect, and operate at multiple scales simultaneously. An AI safety standard might be developed by a technical community, adopted by a platform company, endorsed by an international body, and enforced (or not) by national regulators—with affected users having input at various points but no single "citizenship" that grants them comprehensive democratic participation.

This is the puzzle cosmopolitan democracy attempts to solve: how to create democratic governance structures that match these overlapping networks of actual power and influence.

## The Institutional Design: How do you govern overlapping networks?

Once you accept this network-based view of global governance, the next question becomes practical: how do you actually implement democratic governance across these overlapping systems? Held proposes two key institutional principles.

### Institutional Principle 1 - Multi-level democratic law-making

Definition according to the book (feature 4 of CD in the book):

> Law-making and law enforcement can be developed within this framework at a variety of locations and levels, along with an expansion of the influence of regional and international courts to monitor and check political and social authority.

This feature means that laws are not made and enforced only by national governments. Instead, rules and courts exist at many levels at the same time—local, national, regional, and global—and they work together. Different layers of authority can create and enforce laws, and higher-level courts can step in when lower levels violate rights or abuse power. In simple terms: power is shared across many levels, and multiple courts ensure everyone plays by the rules.

### Institutional Principle 2 - Nested citizenship

The definition from the book:

> People can enjoy membership in the diverse communities which significantly affect them and, accordingly, access to a variety of form: of political participation. Citizenship would be extended, in principle to membership in all cross-cutting political communities, from the local to the global.

This feature means that people are not limited to belonging politically to just one community (usually the nation-state). Instead, they can be citizens in many overlapping communities at once—their city, their region, their country, and also transnational or global bodies that affect their lives. Each level gives them political rights and ways to participate. In simple terms: your political voice follows the real-life sources of power that shape your world, no matter where they sit geographically.

In a federation, people typically have dual citizenship (state + federal), but political participation is still bound to the territorial units of the federation; cross-border or global political membership is not recognized. In a confederation, citizenship remains almost entirely national, and political participation at the confederal level is usually indirect (through governments, not individuals). Cosmopolitan democracy goes further by giving individuals direct political membership in multiple overlapping communities, including global ones. This creates a model where political belonging follows functional interdependence—not just territorial borders—something federations and confederations do only partially or not at all.

### Institutional design principles applied to climate change

Cosmopolitan democracy would redesign climate governance by combining multi-level law-making with nested citizenship. Binding climate rules would be legislated and enforced across local, national, regional, and global levels, supported by courts able to hold states and corporations accountable. At the same time, individuals would gain political membership in these overlapping institutions—from local climate assemblies to global climate authorities—ensuring that those affected have direct influence. Together, these principles create a governance system that matches the transboundary nature of the climate system while ensuring democratic legitimacy beyond the state.

### Institutional design principles applied to digital governance

Digital governance would be reshaped through the same two principles. Multi-level law-making would prevent regulatory gaps and jurisdiction shopping by tech companies: digital rights and AI rules would be enacted and enforced across local, regional, and global institutions. Nested citizenship would give individuals democratic membership in digital governance bodies, allowing users to participate in platform rule-making, regional data authorities, and global AI oversight institutions. Combined, these principles establish a democratic digital polity aligned with the cross-border nature of data flows and platform power.

## The Normative Foundation: What principles should govern the global order?

What is quite important to note is that the book and the theory is actually quite focused on the normative foundation of cosmopolitan democracy. There it is much more detailled in my view than the institutional design. The fact that the design principles are so explicitly spelled out make cosmopolitan democracy quite similiar to federations and dramatically different to confederations, which have basically no normative foundation.

The normative foundations are as follows

### Normative Principle 1 - Cosmopolitan law

Definition according to the book (feature 2 of CD in the book):

> All groups and associations are assumed to have a capacity for self-determination which can be specified by a commitment to the principle of autonomy and specific clusters of rights and obligations. These clusters cut across each network of power and are subsumed under the following categories: health, social, cultural, civic, economic, pacific and political. Together, they form the basis of an empowering legal order - a cosmopolitan democratic law.

This feature means that every community, group, or institution—from states to companies to local associations—has the right to make its own choices (self-determination), but only within a framework of shared global rights and responsibilities. These rights—covering health, social welfare, culture, civic participation, the economy, peace, and politics—apply to everyone, everywhere, regardless of nationality. Together, they make up a kind of cosmopolitan constitution: a legal order that empowers all people and groups to act freely, as long as they respect the autonomy and dignity of others across borders.


### Normative Principle 2 - Universal constitutional principles

Definition according to the book (feature 3 of CD in the book):

> Legal principles are adopted which delimit the form and scope of individual and collective action within the organizations and associations of state, economy and civil society. Certain standards are specified for the treatment of all, which no political regime or association can legitimately violate.

This feature means that everyone—governments, companies, organizations, and citizens—must follow a set of basic rules that protect people’s rights and dignity. These shared rules limit what any actor is allowed to do, no matter how powerful they are. No government or organization can cross certain red lines, such as harming people, violating rights, or acting in ways that undermine democratic participation. Think of it as a global minimum standard for fair treatment that nobody is allowed to violate.

### Normative Principle 3 - Global civic commitment

Definition according to the book (feature 5 of CD in the book):

> The defence of self-determination, the creation of a common structure of political action and the preservation of the democratic good are the overall collective priorities; the commitment to democratic autonomy creates both an agenda of long-term change and a programme of urgent priorities, focused on transforming the conditions of those whose circumstances fall radically short of equal membership in the public realm.

This feature means that the whole political system is built around three shared goals: protecting everyone’s ability to shape their own lives (self-determination), enabling people and communities to act together across borders, and strengthening democracy everywhere. It also means that the system must actively help those who are treated unfairly or excluded from public life. In short: everyone should have an equal voice, shared tools for collective action, and support in overcoming barriers to real participation.

In a federation, shared political action is strong, but its priority is usually unity and constitutional order, not global democratic equality; self-determination is constrained by federal sovereignty. In a confederation, member states keep more autonomy but shared action is weak and mainly voluntary, so protecting democratic equality across all members is not guaranteed and often inconsistent. By contrast, cosmopolitan democracy puts equal self-determination and transnational democratic participation at the center, explicitly requiring joint action to reduce inequalities between communities—something neither federations nor confederations systematically pursue across borders.

### Normative Principle 4 - Cosmopolitan social justice

Definition according to the book (feature 6 of CD in the book):

> Determinate principles of social justice follow: the modus operandi of the production, distribution and the exploitation of resources must be conducive to, and compatible with, the democratic process and a common structure of political action.

This feature means that the way resources are produced, shared, and used must support democracy rather than undermine it. Economic activity—how wealth is created, how benefits and burdens are distributed, and how natural or digital resources are exploited—must be organized so that everyone can participate equally in political life. If certain economic practices concentrate power, create extreme inequality, or block people from democratic participation, they are not acceptable. In short: the economy must work in a way that strengthens democracy, not weakens it.

In a federation, social justice is typically pursued within the borders of the federal state, with redistribution and regulation tied to national citizenship. However, federations seldom apply social justice principles across borders or beyond their own territory. In a confederation, economic coordination is looser and redistribution is minimal or absent, since member states guard their autonomy; ensuring shared social justice across all members is usually not an objective. Cosmopolitan democracy differs by establishing transnational principles of social justice that apply to all people, ensuring that economic practices anywhere do not undermine democratic equality globally. It links resource governance directly to democratic empowerment across borders—something neither federations nor confederations fully do.

### Normative Principle 5 - Non-coercive global order

Definition according to the book (feature 7 of CD in the book):

> The principle of non-coercive relations governs the settlement of disputes, though the use of force must remain a collective option of last resort in the face of clear attacks to eradicate cosmopolitan democratic law. Cosmopolitan democracy might justify the deployment of force, after all other forms of negotiation and sanction have been exhausted, in the context of a threat to international democracy and a denial of democratic rights and obligations by tyrannical regimes, or by circumstances which spiral beyond the control of particular peoples and agents (such as the disintegration of a state).

This feature means that conflicts should be solved peacefully, through dialogue, negotiation, and legal procedures—not through threats or violence. However, if a group or regime tries to destroy basic democratic rights or harm people in a serious way, the international community may use collective force as a last resort to stop the abuse. It’s similar to how a democratic state uses policing only after all peaceful options fail: force is allowed, but only to protect democracy and human rights, and only when everything else has been tried first.

In a federation, the central government typically has the authority to use force internally (e.g., federal police or military) to uphold the constitution, but this coercive power belongs to the federal level, not to a voluntary collective. In a confederation, member states retain almost all control over force; collective coercion is rare and usually requires unanimous consent, making enforcement weak. Cosmopolitan democracy differs by establishing collective, transnational authority over the legitimate use of force, tightly limited to defending democratic rights across borders. It rejects both unilateral interventions and the impotence typical of confederations, instead creating a legally constrained and democratically accountable mechanism for force as a truly last resort.


### Normative principles applied to climate change

Cosmopolitan Law → Climate

Cosmopolitan law would treat climate stability as a universal right and excessive emissions as violations of others’ autonomy and well-being. States, corporations, and communities would hold cross-border duties not to cause climate harm. Emissions, deforestation, and ecological degradation become legally actionable because they infringe shared rights in health, environmental safety, and intergenerational security.

Universal Constitutional Principles → Climate

Universal constitutional principles would establish global minimum environmental standards that no actor may violate—such as limits on pollution, protection of vulnerable populations, and obligations toward future generations. Climate harm becomes a breach of constitutional-level norms, not merely a policy problem.

Global Civic Commitment → Climate

Global civic commitment prioritizes collective action to secure a stable climate as a precondition for democratic autonomy. Because climate impacts silence vulnerable groups and distort equality, the principle demands urgent support for those most affected—through climate finance, adaptation measures, and guaranteed participation of marginalized communities in global decision-making.

Cosmopolitan Social Justice → Climate

Cosmopolitan social justice requires that the distribution of climate burdens and resources support democratic equality. High emitters bear greater responsibilities; vulnerable communities receive greater protections. Just transition, equitable access to clean technology, and fair resource use are not charity—they are democratic obligations to preserve equal political agency.

Non-Coercive Global Order → Climate

In climate governance, disputes over responsibility, compliance, or resource use should be resolved through peaceful, legal, and institutional means: mediation, arbitration, climate courts, and graduated sanctions. Force is almost never relevant, but in an extreme case—if a regime weaponized environmental destruction to undermine democratic rights—collective action could be authorized only as a last, legally constrained resort.

### Normative principles applied to digital governance

Cosmopolitan Law → Digital

Cosmopolitan law would treat digital rights—privacy, data protection, transparency, freedom from algorithmic bias, and access to digital infrastructure—as universal and enforceable across borders. Companies and states would have legally binding obligations not to violate these rights, regardless of jurisdiction.

Universal Constitutional Principles → Digital

Universal constitutional principles would create binding limits on how digital actors may treat individuals: no mass surveillance, no opaque algorithmic manipulation, no discrimination encoded in digital systems. Platform governance and state digital policies must respect constitutional-level digital rights.

Global Civic Commitment → Digital

Global civic commitment requires empowering individuals and communities to participate in shaping global digital rules. It prioritizes efforts to include those currently excluded—those harmed by algorithmic bias, lacking connectivity, or subject to unilateral corporate control. The long-term aim is a democratic digital public sphere where people collectively shape the technologies that govern them.

Cosmopolitan Social Justice → Digital

Cosmopolitan social justice demands that the digital economy be structured to support equal democratic participation. Concentration of digital power, exploitative data extraction, opaque AI, and digital monopolies undermine political equality and therefore violate this principle. Data, compute, and digital infrastructure must be governed in ways that empower—not marginalize—users.

Non-Coercive Global Order → Digital

Digital disputes—cyberattacks, data theft, election interference, platform harms—must be resolved through legal and institutional mechanisms rather than digital retaliation or cyberwarfare. International digital courts and coordinated sanctions replace unilateral responses. Coercive action is legitimate only in extreme cases where digital tools are used to systematically destroy democratic rights.

## Conclusion

* **Cosmopolitan democracy = normatively federal, structurally confederal, but ontologically post-sovereign.**
* It borrows from **federalism** the *constitutionalism*, *rights framework*, and *direct citizenship*.
* It borrows from **confederalism** the *plurality*, *voluntary coordination*, and *respect for local autonomy*.
* But it ultimately **transcends both** by grounding authority in *universal personhood* rather than *member units*.
