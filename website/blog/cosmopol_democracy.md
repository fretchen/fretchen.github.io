In the last few weeks I kept wondering quite a bit about the association between democratic governance and nation-states. Somehow it is quite intrinsically connected to the notion of states and nationality. If I have the passport, I have the right to vote for some governance body et voila. In Europe this has been softed on quite a bit, but the nation remains an integral part to democratic governance models.

But something that I found quite interesting is the the notion of cosmopolitan democracy, which I did not know. So here we go for the moment. The theory has been built quite a bit by David Held in his book "Democracy and the Global Order" (2004) and further developed by Daniele Archibugi.

The post will be structured as follows (for the moment):

- We choose two key issues that require global governance models - climate change and digital governance
- We briefly review two common governance models beyond nation-states - the federal and confederal models . This they allow us to make it easier to understand cosmopolitan democracy and where it differs from our common approaches.

## Two issues at hand climate change and digital governance

Before we dive into the different models, let us first clarify why we even care about democracy beyond nation-states. Two key issues that come to my mind are climate change and digital governance. Both issues are inherently global and require governance models that transcend national borders. We will use these two examples to visualize the different governance models later on.

## The federal model

In the [federal model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalism) we typically have several layers of governance with one federal government on top and several states or regions below. A famous example is the federal model at the example of Germany and the USA. Each of the layers has certain competences and rights that are typically laid out in a shared constitution and enforced by some share institutions like the parliament, the central executive and the courts. In Germany, we have clearly laid out that almost all basic education is within the competency of the regions, while the military monopole is clearly within the federal government. 

The federal model is quite common within democratic states and it is perfectly normal to have a federal states where the citizens vote parliments and the different layer, e.g. for city hall, regional parliaments or the national state.

### Institutuional design principles of federations

Federations rest on four core institutional design principles. 

- First, hierarchical division of competences establishes clear vertical authority where federal law supersedes state law in case of conflict, with constitutional enumeration preventing jurisdictional disputes. 
- Second, territorial subsidiarity ensures decisions are made at the lowest effective territorial level, but always within nested, exclusive territorial units—each level governs its own bounded space without overlap. 
- Third, dual legitimacy balances popular sovereignty with state representation, typically through bicameral legislatures where one chamber represents citizens directly and another represents constituent states. 
- Fourth, constitutional unity maintains a single constitutional order with one primary citizenship, ensuring federal courts have final authority and preventing fragmentation.

Together, these principles create stable multi-level governance within clearly bounded federal territory, but they limit participation to nested territorial units and maintain sharp hierarchies between levels.

### Normative foundations of federalism

Federal systems rest on several implicit normative principles. First, they establish universal rights within federal boundaries - constitutional guarantees that apply equally to all citizens regardless of which state or region they inhabit. The German Basic Law's protection of human dignity or the US Bill of Rights exemplify this: certain standards cannot be violated by any level of government within the federation.
Second, federations embrace a principle of internal subsidiarity and self-determination - the idea that decisions should be made at the most appropriate level, with regions maintaining autonomy in their spheres of competence. However, this self-determination is always constrained by federal constitutional principles and the primacy of federal unity.
Third, most modern federations incorporate commitments to internal social justice - redistribution mechanisms (like Germany's Länderfinanzausgleich) that transfer resources from wealthier to poorer regions to ensure roughly equal living conditions across the federation. This reflects a normative commitment that citizenship in the federation entitles one to certain minimum standards regardless of local economic circumstances.
Crucially, these normative principles apply only within federal boundaries. Federations distinguish sharply between insiders (citizens) and outsiders, with no normative obligations to ensure that external actors enjoy the same rights, self-determination, or social justice. The federal government may treat non-citizens differently, engage in exploitative economic practices externally, or use force abroad under very different principles than those governing internal disputes.

### A federal solution for climate change

A federal solution to climate change would mean creating a central authority with binding powers over all member units — for example, a global or regional federal government empowered to set and enforce emission limits, collect a unified carbon tax, and redistribute revenues for adaptation and green investment.
Individual states or regions could still manage local policies, but ultimate climate goals, standards, and enforcement would be decided federally, much like a national government sets environmental law for its provinces.

### A federal solution for digital governance

A federal solution to digital governance would establish a central digital authority—for instance, a federal “Digital Commission” or “Data Ministry”—with binding power over all member units.
It would set uniform rules for privacy, cybersecurity, AI safety, and platform accountability, ensuring that citizens everywhere enjoy the same digital rights and protections.
Member states or regions could still handle local implementation (e.g., education, infrastructure), but core standards and enforcement—such as data protection laws, content regulation, or antitrust actions—would be decided and applied federally.
In essence, the internet and digital economy would be governed as a single legal space, with one overarching framework rather than a patchwork of national laws.

## The confederal model

The [confederal model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederation) on the other hand is a political union of sovereign states united for purposes of somme common action. Famous examples of confederations are the United Nations, NATO etc. So confederations are a common way to interact between states. The key distinction is the sovereignty of the individual states. They keep their independence but they sign a treaty to act together on some common topic. 

It is an absolutely central distinction that the confederal model has fairly little to do with democracy etc. The states that might participate in the confederation might be democratic or not. But it is very rare to see some kind of democratic instition that is associated with confederations.

Another instersting observation is that quite a number of federal states have been created from previously loosely connected confederations. So there is some common assumption or intuition that any improvement of the UN would mean that the confederation would have to become something like a federal "world state".

### Institutional design principles of confederations

Confederations are built on radically different institutional principles prioritizing state sovereignty.

- First, sovereignty preservation ensures member states retain full independence through unanimous voting, explicit withdrawal rights, and treaty-based rather than constitutional arrangements.
- Second, functional minimalism restricts confederal institutions to only what states explicitly authorize, with no implied powers or expansion of authority beyond the original treaty mandate.
- Third, interstate coordination without hierarchy positions the confederation as a forum for negotiation between equal sovereigns rather than a higher governing authority, with secretariats providing administrative support but holding no independent power.
- Fourth, indirect representation only ensures citizens participate solely through their national governments—there are no direct elections to confederal bodies, no confederal citizenship, and no direct enforcement against individuals. 

These principles maintain state equality and prevent confederal institutions from threatening member sovereignty, but result in weak enforcement, minimal democratic participation, and fragmented governance incapable of addressing problems that transcend state boundaries.

### Normative foundations of confederations

Unlike federations, confederations typically lack robust shared normative principles. The treaty establishing a confederation usually defines narrow functional goals (mutual defense, trade coordination, diplomatic cooperation) without establishing universal rights or justice principles that bind member states.
Member states in a confederation retain the right to maintain radically different internal normative orders. The United Nations, for instance, includes liberal democracies, authoritarian states, and theocracies - there is no requirement that members share commitments to human rights, social justice, or democratic governance (though the UN Charter articulates aspirational principles that are weakly enforced).
Where normative principles appear in confederal arrangements - such as the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights or NATO's democratic governance requirements - they are either non-binding (purely aspirational) or weakly enforced (states can violate them with minimal consequences). The confederal model prioritizes sovereignty over shared principles: if a normative principle conflicts with state sovereignty, sovereignty wins.
This creates what might be called normative minimalism: confederations function with the bare minimum shared principles necessary for coordination, avoiding deeper commitments that might constrain member autonomy. There is typically no commitment to social justice between members, no binding constraints on how states treat their own citizens, and no obligation to resolve disputes non-coercively (beyond non-binding preferences for peaceful resolution).

### Confederations and climate change

In a confederal system, states remain fully sovereign and cooperate voluntarily through treaties and joint commitments, without any binding supranational authority. Climate policy is coordinated through intergovernmental forums—like the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement—where each country sets its own targets and enforcement depends on political will, peer pressure, or reputational costs. This means progress relies on consensus and voluntary compliance rather than legal obligation. In practice, this is almost exactly how global climate governance currently works: a loose confederation of states negotiating collective goals but implementing them nationally.

### Confederations and digital governance

A confederal approach to digital governance would involve states negotiating common principles—for example, around data privacy, cybersecurity, or AI ethics—through voluntary international agreements. Implementation and enforcement would remain at the national level, with each government deciding how to apply shared guidelines. Existing frameworks such as the OECD AI Principles, Council of Europe’s Convention 108, or G7 digital charters embody this model: cooperation without a central regulator, relying on alignment and mutual trust rather than binding federal law. Like climate governance, today’s digital governance is largely confederal—fragmented, consensus-based, and state-led.

## The problem - The existence of overlapping networks of governance

We are now ready to dive into the cosmopolitan democracy model. We will follow the initial definitions from the book by David Held. The following is an extract from the initial book, where he describes the features of of cosmopolitan democracy in table 12.1. For each of the points I will add some notes afterwards. The features are

We can start the discussion with the following essential observation, according to the book (feature 1 in the book):

> The global order consists of multiple and overlapping networks of power involving the body, welfare, culture, civic associations, the economy, coercive relations and organized violence, and regulatory and legal relations. The case for cosmopolitan democracy arises from these diverse networks - the different power systems which constitute the interconnections of different peoples and nations.

Here, cosmopolitan democracy basically says that a lot of politcal topics cut across states and their internal governance. We rather have different networks of issues and these networks should have a suitable governance structure. 

On this topic cosmopolitan democracy is a bit similar to a federation as it recognizes multiple networks of power. However, it goes further as it gives up on the hierachy that is so central to federal states. Compoared to confederations it is more coordinated and do not think that states have complete control of their internal dealings. Pushed to the extreme this feature does not really require the idea of states anymore. However, it remains unclear how the networks would coordinate, how it is decided who is within the networks etc.

### Problem statement applied to climate change

Climate change is a beautiful example of overlapping governance networks. The drivers of emissions involve states, multinational corporations, global markets, and transnational supply chains. The impacts—droughts, heatwaves, floods—spread across borders regardless of political authority. Scientific bodies, NGOs, cities, and financial actors also shape outcomes. This dispersion of power mirrors Held’s argument: global problems are embedded in networks that intersect but do not map neatly onto sovereign states.

### Problem statement applied to digital governance

Digital governance similarly rests on dispersed networks of authority and influence. Tech companies write rules for billions of users; states regulate only part of this domain; NGOs, standards bodies, and open-source communities shape key infrastructures; and data flows connect regions instantly and invisibly. Digital power thus emerges from interactions between state and non-state actors operating across borders, demonstrating why a state-centric model of governance cannot capture the structure of digital life.

## The Institutional Design: How are these principles implemented?

Once, you follow the argument that we need a flexible and overlapping governance structure, the next question is how to implement this in practice. The book actually proposes two key principles that should guide the institutional design of cosmopolitan democracy.

### Institutional Principle 1 - Multi-level democratic law-making

Definition according to the book (feature 4 of CD in the book):

> Law-making and law enforcement can be developed within this framework at a variety of locations and levels, along with an expansion of the influence of regional and international courts to monitor and check political and social authority.

This feature means that laws are not made and enforced only by national governments. Instead, rules and courts exist at many levels at the same time—local, national, regional, and global—and they work together. Different layers of authority can create and enforce laws, and higher-level courts can step in when lower levels violate rights or abuse power. In simple terms: power is shared across many levels, and multiple courts ensure everyone plays by the rules.

### Institutional Principle 2 - Nested citizenship

The definition from the book:

> People can enjoy membership in the diverse communities which significantly affect them and, accordingly, access to a variety of form: of political participation. Citizenship would be extended, in principle to membership in all cross-cutting political communities, from the local to the global.

This feature means that people are not limited to belonging politically to just one community (usually the nation-state). Instead, they can be citizens in many overlapping communities at once—their city, their region, their country, and also transnational or global bodies that affect their lives. Each level gives them political rights and ways to participate. In simple terms: your political voice follows the real-life sources of power that shape your world, no matter where they sit geographically.

In a federation, people typically have dual citizenship (state + federal), but political participation is still bound to the territorial units of the federation; cross-border or global political membership is not recognized. In a confederation, citizenship remains almost entirely national, and political participation at the confederal level is usually indirect (through governments, not individuals). Cosmopolitan democracy goes further by giving individuals direct political membership in multiple overlapping communities, including global ones. This creates a model where political belonging follows functional interdependence—not just territorial borders—something federations and confederations do only partially or not at all.

### Institutional design principles applied to climate change

Cosmopolitan democracy would redesign climate governance by combining multi-level law-making with nested citizenship. Binding climate rules would be legislated and enforced across local, national, regional, and global levels, supported by courts able to hold states and corporations accountable. At the same time, individuals would gain political membership in these overlapping institutions—from local climate assemblies to global climate authorities—ensuring that those affected have direct influence. Together, these principles create a governance system that matches the transboundary nature of the climate system while ensuring democratic legitimacy beyond the state.

### Institutional design principles applied to digital governance

Digital governance would be reshaped through the same two principles. Multi-level law-making would prevent regulatory gaps and jurisdiction shopping by tech companies: digital rights and AI rules would be enacted and enforced across local, regional, and global institutions. Nested citizenship would give individuals democratic membership in digital governance bodies, allowing users to participate in platform rule-making, regional data authorities, and global AI oversight institutions. Combined, these principles establish a democratic digital polity aligned with the cross-border nature of data flows and platform power.

## The Normative Foundation: What principles should govern the global order?

What is quite important to note is that the book and the theory is actually quite focused on the normative foundation of cosmopolitan democracy. There it is much more detailled in my view than the institutional design. The fact that the design principles are so explicitly spelled out make cosmopolitan democracy quite similiar to federations and dramatically different to confederations, which have basically no normative foundation.

The normative foundations are as follows

### Normative Principle 1 - Cosmopolitan law

Definition according to the book (feature 2 of CD in the book):

> All groups and associations are assumed to have a capacity for self-determination which can be specified by a commitment to the principle of autonomy and specific clusters of rights and obligations. These clusters cut across each network of power and are subsumed under the following categories: health, social, cultural, civic, economic, pacific and political. Together, they form the basis of an empowering legal order - a cosmopolitan democratic law.

This feature means that every community, group, or institution—from states to companies to local associations—has the right to make its own choices (self-determination), but only within a framework of shared global rights and responsibilities. These rights—covering health, social welfare, culture, civic participation, the economy, peace, and politics—apply to everyone, everywhere, regardless of nationality. Together, they make up a kind of cosmopolitan constitution: a legal order that empowers all people and groups to act freely, as long as they respect the autonomy and dignity of others across borders.


### Normative Principle 2 - Universal constitutional principles

Definition according to the book (feature 3 of CD in the book):

> Legal principles are adopted which delimit the form and scope of individual and collective action within the organizations and associations of state, economy and civil society. Certain standards are specified for the treatment of all, which no political regime or association can legitimately violate.

This feature means that everyone—governments, companies, organizations, and citizens—must follow a set of basic rules that protect people’s rights and dignity. These shared rules limit what any actor is allowed to do, no matter how powerful they are. No government or organization can cross certain red lines, such as harming people, violating rights, or acting in ways that undermine democratic participation. Think of it as a global minimum standard for fair treatment that nobody is allowed to violate.

### Normative Principle 3 - Global civic commitment

Definition according to the book (feature 5 of CD in the book):

> The defence of self-determination, the creation of a common structure of political action and the preservation of the democratic good are the overall collective priorities; the commitment to democratic autonomy creates both an agenda of long-term change and a programme of urgent priorities, focused on transforming the conditions of those whose circumstances fall radically short of equal membership in the public realm.

This feature means that the whole political system is built around three shared goals: protecting everyone’s ability to shape their own lives (self-determination), enabling people and communities to act together across borders, and strengthening democracy everywhere. It also means that the system must actively help those who are treated unfairly or excluded from public life. In short: everyone should have an equal voice, shared tools for collective action, and support in overcoming barriers to real participation.

In a federation, shared political action is strong, but its priority is usually unity and constitutional order, not global democratic equality; self-determination is constrained by federal sovereignty. In a confederation, member states keep more autonomy but shared action is weak and mainly voluntary, so protecting democratic equality across all members is not guaranteed and often inconsistent. By contrast, cosmopolitan democracy puts equal self-determination and transnational democratic participation at the center, explicitly requiring joint action to reduce inequalities between communities—something neither federations nor confederations systematically pursue across borders.

### Normative Principle 4 - Cosmopolitan social justice

Definition according to the book (feature 6 of CD in the book):

> Determinate principles of social justice follow: the modus operandi of the production, distribution and the exploitation of resources must be conducive to, and compatible with, the democratic process and a common structure of political action.

This feature means that the way resources are produced, shared, and used must support democracy rather than undermine it. Economic activity—how wealth is created, how benefits and burdens are distributed, and how natural or digital resources are exploited—must be organized so that everyone can participate equally in political life. If certain economic practices concentrate power, create extreme inequality, or block people from democratic participation, they are not acceptable. In short: the economy must work in a way that strengthens democracy, not weakens it.

In a federation, social justice is typically pursued within the borders of the federal state, with redistribution and regulation tied to national citizenship. However, federations seldom apply social justice principles across borders or beyond their own territory. In a confederation, economic coordination is looser and redistribution is minimal or absent, since member states guard their autonomy; ensuring shared social justice across all members is usually not an objective. Cosmopolitan democracy differs by establishing transnational principles of social justice that apply to all people, ensuring that economic practices anywhere do not undermine democratic equality globally. It links resource governance directly to democratic empowerment across borders—something neither federations nor confederations fully do.

### Normative Principle 5 - Non-coercive global order

Definition according to the book (feature 7 of CD in the book):

> The principle of non-coercive relations governs the settlement of disputes, though the use of force must remain a collective option of last resort in the face of clear attacks to eradicate cosmopolitan democratic law. Cosmopolitan democracy might justify the deployment of force, after all other forms of negotiation and sanction have been exhausted, in the context of a threat to international democracy and a denial of democratic rights and obligations by tyrannical regimes, or by circumstances which spiral beyond the control of particular peoples and agents (such as the disintegration of a state).

This feature means that conflicts should be solved peacefully, through dialogue, negotiation, and legal procedures—not through threats or violence. However, if a group or regime tries to destroy basic democratic rights or harm people in a serious way, the international community may use collective force as a last resort to stop the abuse. It’s similar to how a democratic state uses policing only after all peaceful options fail: force is allowed, but only to protect democracy and human rights, and only when everything else has been tried first.

In a federation, the central government typically has the authority to use force internally (e.g., federal police or military) to uphold the constitution, but this coercive power belongs to the federal level, not to a voluntary collective. In a confederation, member states retain almost all control over force; collective coercion is rare and usually requires unanimous consent, making enforcement weak. Cosmopolitan democracy differs by establishing collective, transnational authority over the legitimate use of force, tightly limited to defending democratic rights across borders. It rejects both unilateral interventions and the impotence typical of confederations, instead creating a legally constrained and democratically accountable mechanism for force as a truly last resort.


### Normative principles applied to climate change

Cosmopolitan Law → Climate

Cosmopolitan law would treat climate stability as a universal right and excessive emissions as violations of others’ autonomy and well-being. States, corporations, and communities would hold cross-border duties not to cause climate harm. Emissions, deforestation, and ecological degradation become legally actionable because they infringe shared rights in health, environmental safety, and intergenerational security.

Universal Constitutional Principles → Climate

Universal constitutional principles would establish global minimum environmental standards that no actor may violate—such as limits on pollution, protection of vulnerable populations, and obligations toward future generations. Climate harm becomes a breach of constitutional-level norms, not merely a policy problem.

Global Civic Commitment → Climate

Global civic commitment prioritizes collective action to secure a stable climate as a precondition for democratic autonomy. Because climate impacts silence vulnerable groups and distort equality, the principle demands urgent support for those most affected—through climate finance, adaptation measures, and guaranteed participation of marginalized communities in global decision-making.

Cosmopolitan Social Justice → Climate

Cosmopolitan social justice requires that the distribution of climate burdens and resources support democratic equality. High emitters bear greater responsibilities; vulnerable communities receive greater protections. Just transition, equitable access to clean technology, and fair resource use are not charity—they are democratic obligations to preserve equal political agency.

Non-Coercive Global Order → Climate

In climate governance, disputes over responsibility, compliance, or resource use should be resolved through peaceful, legal, and institutional means: mediation, arbitration, climate courts, and graduated sanctions. Force is almost never relevant, but in an extreme case—if a regime weaponized environmental destruction to undermine democratic rights—collective action could be authorized only as a last, legally constrained resort.

### Normative principles applied to digital governance

Cosmopolitan Law → Digital

Cosmopolitan law would treat digital rights—privacy, data protection, transparency, freedom from algorithmic bias, and access to digital infrastructure—as universal and enforceable across borders. Companies and states would have legally binding obligations not to violate these rights, regardless of jurisdiction.

Universal Constitutional Principles → Digital

Universal constitutional principles would create binding limits on how digital actors may treat individuals: no mass surveillance, no opaque algorithmic manipulation, no discrimination encoded in digital systems. Platform governance and state digital policies must respect constitutional-level digital rights.

Global Civic Commitment → Digital

Global civic commitment requires empowering individuals and communities to participate in shaping global digital rules. It prioritizes efforts to include those currently excluded—those harmed by algorithmic bias, lacking connectivity, or subject to unilateral corporate control. The long-term aim is a democratic digital public sphere where people collectively shape the technologies that govern them.

Cosmopolitan Social Justice → Digital

Cosmopolitan social justice demands that the digital economy be structured to support equal democratic participation. Concentration of digital power, exploitative data extraction, opaque AI, and digital monopolies undermine political equality and therefore violate this principle. Data, compute, and digital infrastructure must be governed in ways that empower—not marginalize—users.

Non-Coercive Global Order → Digital

Digital disputes—cyberattacks, data theft, election interference, platform harms—must be resolved through legal and institutional mechanisms rather than digital retaliation or cyberwarfare. International digital courts and coordinated sanctions replace unilateral responses. Coercive action is legitimate only in extreme cases where digital tools are used to systematically destroy democratic rights.

## Conclusion

* **Cosmopolitan democracy = normatively federal, structurally confederal, but ontologically post-sovereign.**
* It borrows from **federalism** the *constitutionalism*, *rights framework*, and *direct citizenship*.
* It borrows from **confederalism** the *plurality*, *voluntary coordination*, and *respect for local autonomy*.
* But it ultimately **transcends both** by grounding authority in *universal personhood* rather than *member units*.
