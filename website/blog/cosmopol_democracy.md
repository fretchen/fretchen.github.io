In the last few weeks I kept wondering quite a bit about the association between democratic governance and nation-states. Somehow it is quite intrinsically connected to the notion of states and nationality. If I have the passport, I have the right to vote for some governance body et voila. In Europe this has been softed on quite a bit, but the nation remains an integral part to democratic governance models.

But something that I found quite interesting is the the notion of cosmopolitan democracy, which I did not know. So here we go for the moment. The theory has been built quite a bit by David Held in his book "Democracy and the Global Order" (2004) and further developed by Daniele Archibugi. In the initial book the notion of cosmopolitan democracy is laid in 8 points:

One model is the federal model where each institution has guiding power over the "lower" institutions. Before we dive into the cosmopolitan democracy model, let us go back to two quite common models that we all experience on a common basis: the federal and confederal models.

## The federal model

In the [federal model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalism) we typically have several layers of governance with one federal government on top and several states or regions below. A famous example is the federal model at the example of Germany and the USA. Each of the layers has certain competences and rights that are typically laid out in a shared constitution and enforced by some share institutions like the parliament, the central executive and the courts. In Germany, we have clearly laid out that almost all basic education is within the competency of the regions, while the military monopole is clearly within the federal government. 

The federal model is quite common within democratic states and it is perfectly normal to have a federal states where the citizens vote parliments and the different layer, e.g. for city hall, regional parliaments or the national state.

## The confederal model

The [confederal model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederation) on the other hand is a political union of sovereign states united for purposes of somme common action. Famous examples of confederations are the United Nations, NATO etc. So confederations are a common way to interact between states. The key distinction is the sovereignty of the individual states. They keep their independence but they sign a treaty to act together on some common topic. 

It is an absolutely central distinction that the confederal model has fairly little to do with democracy etc. The states that might participate in the confederation might be democratic or not. But it is very rare to see some kind of democratic instition that is associated with confederations.

Another instersting observation is that quite a number of federal states have been created from previously loosely connected confederations. So there is some common assumption or intuition that any improvement of the UN would mean that the confederation would have to become something like a federal "world state". And this is exactly where the whole idea of cosmopolitan democracy comes in. It is basically an idea for democratic processes that are not really coupled to nation-states as we know them. The whole thing was set up by David Held and others in the 1990s. 

## Key features of cosmopolitan democracy

The following is an extract from the initial book, where he describes the features of of cosmopolitan democracy in table 12.1. For each of the points I will add some notes afterwards. The features are

### Feature 1 - Overlapping networks of governance

Definition according to the book:

> The global order consists of multiple and overlapping networks of power involving the body, welfare, culture, civic associations, the economy, coercive relations and organized violence, and regulatory and legal relations. The case for cosmopolitan democracy arises from these diverse networks - the different power systems which constitute the interconnections of different peoples and nations.

On this topic cosmopolitan democracy is a bit similar to a federation as it recognizes multiple networks of power. However, it goes further as it gives up on the hierachy that is so central to federal states. Compoared to confederations it is more coordinated and do not think that states have complete control of their internal dealings. Pushed to the extreme this feature does not really require the idea of states anymore. However, it remains unclear how the networks would coordinate, how it is decided who is within the networks etc.

2. **Feature 2 - Cosmopolitan law:** All groups and associations are assumed to have a capacity for self-determination which can be specified by a commitment to the principle of autonomy and specific clusters of rights and obligations. These clusters cut across each network of power and are subsumed under the following categories: health, social, cultural, civic, economic, pacific and political. Together, they form the basis of an empowering legal order - a cosmopolitan democratic law.

3. **Feature 3 - Universal constitutional principles:** Legal principles are adopted which delimit the form and scope of individual and collective action within the organizations and associations of state, economy and civil society. Certain standards are specified for the treatment of all, which no political regime or association can legitimately violate.

4. **Feature 4 - Multi-level democratic law-making:** Law-making and law enforcement can be developed within this framework at a variety of locations and levels, along with an expansion of the influence of regional and international courts to monitor and check political and social authority.

5. **Feature 5 - Global civic commitment:** The defence of self-determination, the creation of a common structure of political action and the preservation of the democratic good are the overall collective priorities; the commitment to democratic autonomy creates both an agenda of long-term change and a programme of urgent priorities, focused on transforming the conditions of those whose circumstances fall radically short of equal membership in the public realm.

6. **Feature 6 - Cosmopolitan social justice:** Determinate principles of social justice follow: the modus operandi of the production, distribution and the exploitation of resources must be conducive to, and compatible with, the democratic process and a common structure of political action.

7. **Feature 7 - Non-coercive global order:** The principle of non-coercive relations governs the settlement of disputes, though the use of force must remain a collective option of last resort in the face of clear attacks to eradicate cosmopolitan democratic law. Cosmopolitan democracy might justify the deployment of force, after all other forms of negotiation and sanction have been exhausted, in the context of a threat to international democracy and a denial of democratic rights and obligations by tyrannical regimes, or by circumstances which spiral beyond the con-rol of particular peoples and agents (such as the disintegration of a state).

8. **Feature 8 - Nested citizenship:** People can enjoy membership in the diverse communities which significantly affect them and, accordingly, access to a variety of form: of political participation. Citizenship would be extended, in principle to membership in all cross-cutting political communities, from the local to the global.


## Comparison between the different models of democracy

Excellent — that’s one of the most fruitful analytical comparisons in global governance theory.
Comparing **cosmopolitan democracy** with **confederations** and **federations** clarifies both its *institutional radicalism* and its *continuities with familiar constitutional models*.

Below is a systematic comparison across the **seven key features** (condensing your eight into seven thematic clusters). For each feature I indicate:

* ✅ **Resemblance / overlap**
* ⚖️ **Partial overlap or tension**
* ❌ **Mutually exclusive or conceptually incompatible**

### **1. Power structure: overlapping networks of governance**

|                         | Cosmopolitan Democracy                                                                                                                | Confederation                                                                           | Federation                                                                          |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Nature of authority** | Overlapping, multi-level, non-hierarchical networks of power; sovereignty diffused.                                                   | Loose association of sovereign states; authority remains with members.                  | Dual sovereignty: shared between federal and constituent units, legally entrenched. |
| **Relation**            | ✅ Shares the *multi-level* character of a federation.                                                                                 | ⚖️ More overlapping and less clearly delimited than either confederation or federation. | ❌ Rejects the single constitutional center typical of a federation.                 |
| **Summary**             | Cosmopolitan democracy is *polycentric*, not just multi-level; it dissolves clear sovereignty boundaries rather than allocating them. |                                                                                         |                                                                                     |

| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Source of law** | Universal rights binding across jurisdictions (“cosmopolitan law”).                                              | Intergovernmental treaties or compacts; no direct legal authority over citizens. | Constitution with direct effect; citizens subject to both federal and state law. |
| **Relation**      | ✅ Resembles federal direct effect of law on individuals.                                                         | ❌ Incompatible with the weak legal authority of confederations.                  |                                                                                  |
| **Summary**       | Cosmopolitan law is *federal-like* in reach but *cosmopolitan* in moral source (humanity, not state membership). |                                                                                  |                                                                                  |

| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Binding norms** | Universal democratic principles constrain all associations.                              | Minimal norms; members retain discretion.           | Federal constitution constrains sub-units and center. |
| **Relation**      | ✅ Closer to federalism’s constitutional binding.                                         | ❌ Conflicts with the voluntarism of confederations. |                                                       |
| **Summary**       | Cosmopolitan democracy implies a *global constitutionalism*, not voluntary coordination. |                                                     |                                                       |

| **Relation**              | ⚖️ Similar to federation in needing transnational legislation, but more flexible and overlapping.                     | ❌ Rejects unanimity and strict intergovernmentalism.              |                                               |
| **Summary**               | Cosmopolitan democracy combines the *legislative directness* of a federation with the *pluralism* of a confederation. |                                                                   |                                               |

| **Relation**                | ⚖️ Shares the federative commitment to joint self-rule, but without exclusive territorial citizenship.                    | ❌ Incompatible with the state-centric membership of both confederations and federations. |                                                   |
| **Summary**                 | Cosmopolitan democracy replaces *territorial self-determination* with *relational self-determination* across communities. |                                                                                          |                                                   |

### **In short**

* **Cosmopolitan democracy = normatively federal, structurally confederal, but ontologically post-sovereign.**
* It borrows from **federalism** the *constitutionalism*, *rights framework*, and *direct citizenship*.
* It borrows from **confederalism** the *plurality*, *voluntary coordination*, and *respect for local autonomy*.
* But it ultimately **transcends both** by grounding authority in *universal personhood* rather than *member units*.

Would you like me to make a **visual comparison matrix or diagram** (e.g., triangular chart placing each system by degree of hierarchy vs autonomy vs universality)? It helps a lot when you present this in a policy or academic setting.










Here, I follow the paper / notes by Daniele Archibugi on cosmopolitan democracy [here](https://www.danielearchibugi.org/downloads/papers/2017/11/Principles.pdf).


First thing is that he analyses different levels of democracy:

- **Democracy inside nations**: When he was writing it he had the optimistic point of view that democracy inside a nation is a universal aspiration. In 2026 we might be hesitant to see this a universal goal by governments and citizens in all countries.

- **Democracy among states**: He describes it as respect for reciprocal sovereignty and shared norms. He mentions also the criterion of "one state one vote" as a possible democratic principle. 

- **Global democracy**: This is for global problems like climate change, migration, pandemics etc. that require global governance models. This one is especially complex as global problems easily stand in conflict with self-interests of nations. An example given there is nuclear wast. "It may, for example, be in the interest of the French public to obtain cheap nuclear energy if they manage to dispose of radioactive waste in a Pacific isle under their control, but this will obviously
be against the interests of the public living there."


## Confederal model

Archibugi defines the confederation as "an association of sovereign states which, through an appropriate treaty, reach an agreement on given issues." Big examples are NATO or the UN.

### Confederations and democracy inside nations

Confederation rely on the principle of mutual recognition and respect for sovereignty. This means that they do not envisage a channel of direct intervention to promote democracy within nations. Not even in blatant cases of violation of fundamental human rights - genocide, for example - is the confederation entitled to intervene in a state's domestic affairs. What happens within the nation remains its own business.

### Confederations and democracy among states

Democracy amongst nations might be very possible within confederations. However, he points out that there is very little connection to the democracy inside nations. You might have completely authoritarian regimes that are part of democratic confederations. The only requirement is that the representatives of the states are entitled to sign treaties and agreements. So you might have a democratic confederation of states that is even used to enforce tyranny within the individual nations. A historically cited examples which went into this direction is the Congress of Vienna in 1815.

### Confederations and global democracy

Within the confederal model global democracy is quite limited. Quite importantly the governments are mostly obliged to represent the interest of their individual states. This means that global problems that are not in the interest of the individual states are quite hard to solve. We all know how the discussions around global warming and environmental issues are currently going...

## The federal model

The federal model is described a substantially more rigid set of institutional rules that applies to each member state. Cited examples are Switzerland, Germany or the United States. All of them started out as confederations and increasingly centralized power to the point that they had a joint constitution with a federal government. Quite interestingly, this experience leads to a common assumption that that world peace and democracy can only be achieved through federalism and some kind of a "world government".

### Federalism and democracy inside nations

Here, Archibugi ist really skeptical if a federal model can enforce democracy within the nations. The main argument is that the world culturally just too diverse to find sufficient common ground for one joint constitution.

### Federalism and democracy among states

Here, the situation is again quite strange. Because once you have a federal model, the states have been disolved and have become part of the federal state. So there are constant struggles of competence given to the central or the federal governments. So the system of voting that existed in the confederal model is not really applicable anymore.

### Federalism and global democracy

Interestingly, a central federal power would have the authority and competence to address global problems on the basis of democratic principles. But quite interestingly it would have a fairly homogenous view on the world and be likely tempted to ignore local interests. It would be a very technocratic and top-down approach to global democracy. He cites the government of guardians dear to Plato (What is this ?).

## Cosmopolitan model

It is described as midway between confederation and federalism. Interestingly the EU is described as having elements of this. Not quite federal but certainly more than a confederation. The ambition is to have institutions that can tackle global problems and problems of massive human rights violation.

In the cosmopolitan model, the idea of sovereignty typical of the confederal and federal models is also profoundly changed. States, in fact, preserve their internal sovereignty vis-a-vis other states, but their sovereignty is eroded - including legally - by the transfer of functions to intergovernmental and non-governmental bodies. External sovereignty may also be eroded or, paraphrasing the young Kelsen, may become less 'dogmatic'


## Cosmopolitan democracy inside nations

The idea of the cosmopolitan model is that the supranational institutions have the competence to intervene in the domestic affairs of states in order to promote democracy and protect human rights.


Since one state's intervention in the domestic affairs of another has no legal foundation and may be instrumental, the cosmopolitan model entrusts civil society as opposed to national governments with the task of 'interfering' in the domestic affairs of another state.

## Cosmopolitan democracy among states

Basically it all runs through multilateralism.

## Cosmopolitan democracy and global democracy

Global issues are here transferred to global institutions, which are directly elected.

the federal model at the example of Germany and the EU. This will help us later to understand the cosmopolitan democracy model better.

## Federal model - Germany

Germany is a federal republic consisting of 16 states (Bundesländer), each with its own constitution and government. The Basic Law (Grundgesetz) serves as the constitution for the entire country, establishing a division of powers between the federal government and the states. This model allows for a degree of autonomy and self-determination for each state while maintaining a unified national framework.


## Federal model - European Union

The European Union (EU) presents a unique example of a federal-like structure on a supranational level. Member states retain their sovereignty but delegate certain powers to EU institutions, creating a complex web of governance that transcends national borders. This interplay between national and supranational authority is a key feature of the federal model.
