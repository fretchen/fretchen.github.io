In the last few weeks I kept wondering quite a bit about the association between democratic governance and nation-states. Somehow it is quite intrinsically connected to the notion of states and nationality. If I have the passport, I have the right to vote for some governance body et voila. In Europe this has been softed on quite a bit, but the nation remains an integral part to democratic governance models.

But something that I found quite interesting is the the notion of cosmopolitan democracy, which I did not know. So here we go for the moment. The theory has been built quite a bit by David Held in his book "Democracy and the Global Order" (2004) and further developed by Daniele Archibugi.

The post will be structured as follows (for the moment):

- We choose two key issues that require global governance models - climate change and digital governance
- We briefly review two common governance models beyond nation-states - the federal and confederal models . This they allow us to make it easier to understand cosmopolitan democracy and where it differs from our common approaches.

## Two issues at hand climate change and digital governance

Before we dive into the different models, let us first clarify why we even care about democracy beyond nation-states. Two key issues that come to my mind are climate change and digital governance. Both issues are inherently global and require governance models that transcend national borders. We will use these two examples to visualize the different governance models later on.


## The federal model

In the [federal model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalism) we typically have several layers of governance with one federal government on top and several states or regions below. A famous example is the federal model at the example of Germany and the USA. Each of the layers has certain competences and rights that are typically laid out in a shared constitution and enforced by some share institutions like the parliament, the central executive and the courts. In Germany, we have clearly laid out that almost all basic education is within the competency of the regions, while the military monopole is clearly within the federal government. 

The federal model is quite common within democratic states and it is perfectly normal to have a federal states where the citizens vote parliments and the different layer, e.g. for city hall, regional parliaments or the national state.

### A federal solution for climate change

A federal solution to climate change would mean creating a central authority with binding powers over all member units — for example, a global or regional federal government empowered to set and enforce emission limits, collect a unified carbon tax, and redistribute revenues for adaptation and green investment.
Individual states or regions could still manage local policies, but ultimate climate goals, standards, and enforcement would be decided federally, much like a national government sets environmental law for its provinces.

### A federal solution for digital governance

A federal solution to digital governance would establish a central digital authority—for instance, a federal “Digital Commission” or “Data Ministry”—with binding power over all member units.
It would set uniform rules for privacy, cybersecurity, AI safety, and platform accountability, ensuring that citizens everywhere enjoy the same digital rights and protections.
Member states or regions could still handle local implementation (e.g., education, infrastructure), but core standards and enforcement—such as data protection laws, content regulation, or antitrust actions—would be decided and applied federally.
In essence, the internet and digital economy would be governed as a single legal space, with one overarching framework rather than a patchwork of national laws.

## The confederal model

The [confederal model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederation) on the other hand is a political union of sovereign states united for purposes of somme common action. Famous examples of confederations are the United Nations, NATO etc. So confederations are a common way to interact between states. The key distinction is the sovereignty of the individual states. They keep their independence but they sign a treaty to act together on some common topic. 

It is an absolutely central distinction that the confederal model has fairly little to do with democracy etc. The states that might participate in the confederation might be democratic or not. But it is very rare to see some kind of democratic instition that is associated with confederations.

Another instersting observation is that quite a number of federal states have been created from previously loosely connected confederations. So there is some common assumption or intuition that any improvement of the UN would mean that the confederation would have to become something like a federal "world state".

### Confederations and climate change

In a confederal system, states remain fully sovereign and cooperate voluntarily through treaties and joint commitments, without any binding supranational authority. Climate policy is coordinated through intergovernmental forums—like the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement—where each country sets its own targets and enforcement depends on political will, peer pressure, or reputational costs. This means progress relies on consensus and voluntary compliance rather than legal obligation. In practice, this is almost exactly how global climate governance currently works: a loose confederation of states negotiating collective goals but implementing them nationally.

### Confederations and digital governance

A confederal approach to digital governance would involve states negotiating common principles—for example, around data privacy, cybersecurity, or AI ethics—through voluntary international agreements. Implementation and enforcement would remain at the national level, with each government deciding how to apply shared guidelines. Existing frameworks such as the OECD AI Principles, Council of Europe’s Convention 108, or G7 digital charters embody this model: cooperation without a central regulator, relying on alignment and mutual trust rather than binding federal law. Like climate governance, today’s digital governance is largely confederal—fragmented, consensus-based, and state-led.

## The problem - The existence of overlapping networks of governance

We are now ready to dive into the cosmopolitan democracy model. We will follow the initial definitions from the book by David Held. The following is an extract from the initial book, where he describes the features of of cosmopolitan democracy in table 12.1. For each of the points I will add some notes afterwards. The features are

We can start the discussion with the following essential observation, according to the book (feature 1 in the book):

> The global order consists of multiple and overlapping networks of power involving the body, welfare, culture, civic associations, the economy, coercive relations and organized violence, and regulatory and legal relations. The case for cosmopolitan democracy arises from these diverse networks - the different power systems which constitute the interconnections of different peoples and nations.

Here, cosmopolitan democracy basically says that a lot of politcal topics cut across states and their internal governance. We rather have different networks of issues and these networks should have a suitable governance structure. 

On this topic cosmopolitan democracy is a bit similar to a federation as it recognizes multiple networks of power. However, it goes further as it gives up on the hierachy that is so central to federal states. Compoared to confederations it is more coordinated and do not think that states have complete control of their internal dealings. Pushed to the extreme this feature does not really require the idea of states anymore. However, it remains unclear how the networks would coordinate, how it is decided who is within the networks etc.

### Problem statement applied to climate change

Climate change is a beautiful example of overlapping governance networks. The drivers of emissions involve states, multinational corporations, global markets, and transnational supply chains. The impacts—droughts, heatwaves, floods—spread across borders regardless of political authority. Scientific bodies, NGOs, cities, and financial actors also shape outcomes. This dispersion of power mirrors Held’s argument: global problems are embedded in networks that intersect but do not map neatly onto sovereign states.

### Problem statement applied to digital governance

Digital governance similarly rests on dispersed networks of authority and influence. Tech companies write rules for billions of users; states regulate only part of this domain; NGOs, standards bodies, and open-source communities shape key infrastructures; and data flows connect regions instantly and invisibly. Digital power thus emerges from interactions between state and non-state actors operating across borders, demonstrating why a state-centric model of governance cannot capture the structure of digital life.

## The Institutional Design: How are these principles implemented?

Once, you follow the argument that we need a flexible and overlapping governance structure, the next question is how to implement this in practice. The book actually proposes two key principles that should guide the institutional design of cosmopolitan democracy.

### Institutional Principle 1 - Multi-level democratic law-making

Definition according to the book (feature 4 of CD in the book):

> Law-making and law enforcement can be developed within this framework at a variety of locations and levels, along with an expansion of the influence of regional and international courts to monitor and check political and social authority.

This feature means that laws are not made and enforced only by national governments. Instead, rules and courts exist at many levels at the same time—local, national, regional, and global—and they work together. Different layers of authority can create and enforce laws, and higher-level courts can step in when lower levels violate rights or abuse power. In simple terms: power is shared across many levels, and multiple courts ensure everyone plays by the rules.

### Institutional Principle 2 - Nested citizenship

The definition from the book:

> People can enjoy membership in the diverse communities which significantly affect them and, accordingly, access to a variety of form: of political participation. Citizenship would be extended, in principle to membership in all cross-cutting political communities, from the local to the global.

This feature means that people are not limited to belonging politically to just one community (usually the nation-state). Instead, they can be citizens in many overlapping communities at once—their city, their region, their country, and also transnational or global bodies that affect their lives. Each level gives them political rights and ways to participate. In simple terms: your political voice follows the real-life sources of power that shape your world, no matter where they sit geographically.

In a federation, people typically have dual citizenship (state + federal), but political participation is still bound to the territorial units of the federation; cross-border or global political membership is not recognized. In a confederation, citizenship remains almost entirely national, and political participation at the confederal level is usually indirect (through governments, not individuals). Cosmopolitan democracy goes further by giving individuals direct political membership in multiple overlapping communities, including global ones. This creates a model where political belonging follows functional interdependence—not just territorial borders—something federations and confederations do only partially or not at all.

### Institutional design principles applied to climate change

Cosmopolitan democracy would redesign climate governance by combining multi-level law-making with nested citizenship. Binding climate rules would be legislated and enforced across local, national, regional, and global levels, supported by courts able to hold states and corporations accountable. At the same time, individuals would gain political membership in these overlapping institutions—from local climate assemblies to global climate authorities—ensuring that those affected have direct influence. Together, these principles create a governance system that matches the transboundary nature of the climate system while ensuring democratic legitimacy beyond the state.

### Institutional design principles applied to digital governance

Digital governance would be reshaped through the same two principles. Multi-level law-making would prevent regulatory gaps and jurisdiction shopping by tech companies: digital rights and AI rules would be enacted and enforced across local, regional, and global institutions. Nested citizenship would give individuals democratic membership in digital governance bodies, allowing users to participate in platform rule-making, regional data authorities, and global AI oversight institutions. Combined, these principles establish a democratic digital polity aligned with the cross-border nature of data flows and platform power.

## The Normative Foundation: What principles should govern the global order?

What is quite important to note is that the book and the theory is actually quite focused on the normative foundation of cosmopolitan democracy. There it is much more detailled in my view than the institutional design.

QUESTION TO ME: HOW DO THESE PRINCIPLES APPEAR ? WHO DECIDES WHAT THEY ARE ? IS THIS SOME KIND OF CONSTITUTION ? ANSWER: THEY ARE NORMATIVE PRINCIPLES THAT SHOULD GUIDE THE INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN. SO THEY ARE NOT INSTITUTIONS THEMSELVES, BUT ASSUMPATIONS OF THE DESIGN.

The normative foundations are as follows

### Normative Principle 1 - Cosmopolitan law

Definition according to the book (feature 2 of CD in the book):

> All groups and associations are assumed to have a capacity for self-determination which can be specified by a commitment to the principle of autonomy and specific clusters of rights and obligations. These clusters cut across each network of power and are subsumed under the following categories: health, social, cultural, civic, economic, pacific and political. Together, they form the basis of an empowering legal order - a cosmopolitan democratic law.

This feature means that every community, group, or institution—from states to companies to local associations—has the right to make its own choices (self-determination), but only within a framework of shared global rights and responsibilities. These rights—covering health, social welfare, culture, civic participation, the economy, peace, and politics—apply to everyone, everywhere, regardless of nationality. Together, they make up a kind of cosmopolitan constitution: a legal order that empowers all people and groups to act freely, as long as they respect the autonomy and dignity of others across borders.


### Normative Principle 2 - Universal constitutional principles

Definition according to the book (feature 3 of CD in the book):

> Legal principles are adopted which delimit the form and scope of individual and collective action within the organizations and associations of state, economy and civil society. Certain standards are specified for the treatment of all, which no political regime or association can legitimately violate.

This feature means that everyone—governments, companies, organizations, and citizens—must follow a set of basic rules that protect people’s rights and dignity. These shared rules limit what any actor is allowed to do, no matter how powerful they are. No government or organization can cross certain red lines, such as harming people, violating rights, or acting in ways that undermine democratic participation. Think of it as a global minimum standard for fair treatment that nobody is allowed to violate.

### Normative Principle 3 - Global civic commitment

Definition according to the book (feature 5 of CD in the book):

> The defence of self-determination, the creation of a common structure of political action and the preservation of the democratic good are the overall collective priorities; the commitment to democratic autonomy creates both an agenda of long-term change and a programme of urgent priorities, focused on transforming the conditions of those whose circumstances fall radically short of equal membership in the public realm.

This feature means that the whole political system is built around three shared goals: protecting everyone’s ability to shape their own lives (self-determination), enabling people and communities to act together across borders, and strengthening democracy everywhere. It also means that the system must actively help those who are treated unfairly or excluded from public life. In short: everyone should have an equal voice, shared tools for collective action, and support in overcoming barriers to real participation.

In a federation, shared political action is strong, but its priority is usually unity and constitutional order, not global democratic equality; self-determination is constrained by federal sovereignty. In a confederation, member states keep more autonomy but shared action is weak and mainly voluntary, so protecting democratic equality across all members is not guaranteed and often inconsistent. By contrast, cosmopolitan democracy puts equal self-determination and transnational democratic participation at the center, explicitly requiring joint action to reduce inequalities between communities—something neither federations nor confederations systematically pursue across borders.

### Normative Principle 4 - Cosmopolitan social justice

Definition according to the book (feature 6 of CD in the book):

> Determinate principles of social justice follow: the modus operandi of the production, distribution and the exploitation of resources must be conducive to, and compatible with, the democratic process and a common structure of political action.

This feature means that the way resources are produced, shared, and used must support democracy rather than undermine it. Economic activity—how wealth is created, how benefits and burdens are distributed, and how natural or digital resources are exploited—must be organized so that everyone can participate equally in political life. If certain economic practices concentrate power, create extreme inequality, or block people from democratic participation, they are not acceptable. In short: the economy must work in a way that strengthens democracy, not weakens it.

In a federation, social justice is typically pursued within the borders of the federal state, with redistribution and regulation tied to national citizenship. However, federations seldom apply social justice principles across borders or beyond their own territory. In a confederation, economic coordination is looser and redistribution is minimal or absent, since member states guard their autonomy; ensuring shared social justice across all members is usually not an objective. Cosmopolitan democracy differs by establishing transnational principles of social justice that apply to all people, ensuring that economic practices anywhere do not undermine democratic equality globally. It links resource governance directly to democratic empowerment across borders—something neither federations nor confederations fully do.

### Normative Principle 5 - Non-coercive global order

Definition according to the book (feature 7 of CD in the book):

> The principle of non-coercive relations governs the settlement of disputes, though the use of force must remain a collective option of last resort in the face of clear attacks to eradicate cosmopolitan democratic law. Cosmopolitan democracy might justify the deployment of force, after all other forms of negotiation and sanction have been exhausted, in the context of a threat to international democracy and a denial of democratic rights and obligations by tyrannical regimes, or by circumstances which spiral beyond the control of particular peoples and agents (such as the disintegration of a state).

This feature means that conflicts should be solved peacefully, through dialogue, negotiation, and legal procedures—not through threats or violence. However, if a group or regime tries to destroy basic democratic rights or harm people in a serious way, the international community may use collective force as a last resort to stop the abuse. It’s similar to how a democratic state uses policing only after all peaceful options fail: force is allowed, but only to protect democracy and human rights, and only when everything else has been tried first.

In a federation, the central government typically has the authority to use force internally (e.g., federal police or military) to uphold the constitution, but this coercive power belongs to the federal level, not to a voluntary collective. In a confederation, member states retain almost all control over force; collective coercion is rare and usually requires unanimous consent, making enforcement weak. Cosmopolitan democracy differs by establishing collective, transnational authority over the legitimate use of force, tightly limited to defending democratic rights across borders. It rejects both unilateral interventions and the impotence typical of confederations, instead creating a legally constrained and democratically accountable mechanism for force as a truly last resort.


### Normative principles applied to climate change


### Normative principles applied to digital governance



#### Feature 3 applied to climate change

Applied to climate change, this feature would establish binding global standards on what states and companies are allowed to do environmentally. For example, no actor could legitimately pollute in a way that harms the health, livelihoods, or climate stability of others. Activities like excessive emissions, ecosystem destruction, or exporting pollution to poorer countries would be prohibited because they violate shared rights to environmental safety and intergenerational justice. In short, climate action is no longer optional or voluntary—it becomes a global legal obligation embedded in universal standards.

#### Feature 3 applied to digital governance

In digital governance, this principle would mean that all digital actors—states, tech companies, civil societies, and users—have autonomy in shaping digital life, but within a global framework of digital rights and duties. Individuals everywhere would have enforceable rights to privacy, transparency, data ownership, and free expression, while organizations would bear obligations to respect those rights, regardless of where they operate. Cosmopolitan democratic law would thus guarantee that the digital sphere is governed not just by national laws or corporate policies, but by a universal legal standard protecting human autonomy and participation in the digital world.

#### Feature 5 applied to climate change

Applied to climate change, this feature would mean prioritizing collective global action to protect the democratic rights of all people—especially those most harmed by climate impacts. It would treat access to a stable climate as a precondition for self-determination and democratic participation. Because vulnerable groups and countries lack equal power, cosmopolitan democracy would require urgent measures to support them: climate finance, adaptation aid, technology sharing, and guaranteed participation in global decision-making. The long-term goal would be a shared, democratic climate regime that ensures everyone can equally shape the ecological future they depend on.

#### Feature 5 applied to digital governance

In digital governance, this feature would prioritize universal digital self-determination—the ability of all individuals and communities to control how digital systems affect their lives. It would require building democratic institutions that let people participate in shaping global digital rules, rather than leaving decisions to powerful states or tech corporations. Immediate priorities would focus on groups currently excluded or exploited (e.g., those harmed by algorithmic bias, surveillance, or lack of connectivity). Long-term, the goal would be a shared democratic digital sphere where everyone has equal voice, fair access, and protection of digital rights, ensuring meaningful participation for all.

#### Feature 6 applied to climate change

Applied to climate change, this feature would require that the world’s resource use—especially fossil fuels, land, and critical minerals—be organized in a way that supports global democratic equality. High-emission production methods that harm vulnerable populations would be considered violations of social justice because they undermine those groups’ ability to participate in public life. Climate finance, fair distribution of mitigation burdens, just transition policies, and equitable access to green technologies become democratic requirements, not optional acts of charity. The central idea: the global economy must not produce climate harms that silence or marginalize people politically.

#### Feature 6 applied to digital governance

In digital governance, this feature would mean that systems of data production, digital infrastructure, AI development, and platform economics must operate in ways that empower democratic participation rather than concentrate power in a few hands. Practices like exploitative data extraction, opaque algorithms, monopolistic platform dominance, or digital exclusion would be unacceptable because they obstruct equal political voice. Instead, access to digital infrastructure, fair data governance, transparent algorithms, and equitable control over digital resources (such as data and compute) would be treated as matters of global social justice, necessary for meaningful participation in a digital democracy.

#### Feature 7 applied to climate change

Applied to climate change, this feature would emphasize non-coercive global conflict resolution—mediation, arbitration, climate courts, and graduated sanctions—to settle disputes over emissions, resources, or climate responsibilities. Force would almost never be relevant, because climate disputes are not typically violent. But, theoretically, if a regime engaged in destructive environmental actions that massively endangered human life and democratic rights (for example, intentionally causing ecological collapse or weaponizing environmental destruction), cosmopolitan democracy would allow collective intervention only after exhaustive peaceful measures. In practice, this would translate mostly into strong legal pressure, sanctions, and multilateral accountability rather than military force.

#### Feature 7 applied to digital governance


Applied to digital governance, this feature would prioritize peaceful, rules-based mechanisms to handle conflicts over cyberattacks, data theft, misinformation campaigns, or digital rights violations. Disputes would be settled through international digital courts, mediation panels, and coordinated sanctions, rather than unilateral retaliation or cyberwarfare. Collective force would only be considered in the extreme case where a regime or actor uses digital tools to systematically destroy democratic structures—for example, disabling critical infrastructure, mass-surveilling populations, or manipulating elections on a massive scale. Even then, coercive action would be allowed only as a last, collectively authorized step, ensuring that responses remain legitimate, limited, and democratically accountable.





#### Feature 2 applied to climate change

Applied to climate change, this principle would mean that each community and actor—governments, cities, corporations, civil groups—can pursue their own climate strategies, but they must do so within a shared global legal framework that protects the environmental rights of all. That could include universal rights to a stable climate, clean air, and sustainable development, as well as corresponding duties not to harm others through pollution or ecological destruction. In practice, a cosmopolitan democratic law of climate change would treat emitting carbon or destroying ecosystems as violations of others’ rights, enforceable across borders and through transnational courts or citizen action.

#### Feature 2 applied to digital governance

In digital governance, this principle would mean that all digital actors—states, tech companies, civil societies, and users—have autonomy in shaping digital life, but within a global framework of digital rights and duties. Individuals everywhere would have enforceable rights to privacy, transparency, data ownership, and free expression, while organizations would bear obligations to respect those rights, regardless of where they operate. Cosmopolitan democratic law would thus guarantee that the digital sphere is governed not just by national laws or corporate policies, but by a universal legal standard protecting human autonomy and participation in the digital world.







## Comparison between the different models of democracy

Excellent — that’s one of the most fruitful analytical comparisons in global governance theory.
Comparing **cosmopolitan democracy** with **confederations** and **federations** clarifies both its *institutional radicalism* and its *continuities with familiar constitutional models*.

Below is a systematic comparison across the **seven key features** (condensing your eight into seven thematic clusters). For each feature I indicate:

* ✅ **Resemblance / overlap**
* ⚖️ **Partial overlap or tension**
* ❌ **Mutually exclusive or conceptually incompatible**

### **In short**

* **Cosmopolitan democracy = normatively federal, structurally confederal, but ontologically post-sovereign.**
* It borrows from **federalism** the *constitutionalism*, *rights framework*, and *direct citizenship*.
* It borrows from **confederalism** the *plurality*, *voluntary coordination*, and *respect for local autonomy*.
* But it ultimately **transcends both** by grounding authority in *universal personhood* rather than *member units*.

Would you like me to make a **visual comparison matrix or diagram** (e.g., triangular chart placing each system by degree of hierarchy vs autonomy vs universality)? It helps a lot when you present this in a policy or academic setting.










Here, I follow the paper / notes by Daniele Archibugi on cosmopolitan democracy [here](https://www.danielearchibugi.org/downloads/papers/2017/11/Principles.pdf).


First thing is that he analyses different levels of democracy:

- **Democracy inside nations**: When he was writing it he had the optimistic point of view that democracy inside a nation is a universal aspiration. In 2026 we might be hesitant to see this a universal goal by governments and citizens in all countries.

- **Democracy among states**: He describes it as respect for reciprocal sovereignty and shared norms. He mentions also the criterion of "one state one vote" as a possible democratic principle. 

- **Global democracy**: This is for global problems like climate change, migration, pandemics etc. that require global governance models. This one is especially complex as global problems easily stand in conflict with self-interests of nations. An example given there is nuclear wast. "It may, for example, be in the interest of the French public to obtain cheap nuclear energy if they manage to dispose of radioactive waste in a Pacific isle under their control, but this will obviously
be against the interests of the public living there."


## Confederal model

Archibugi defines the confederation as "an association of sovereign states which, through an appropriate treaty, reach an agreement on given issues." Big examples are NATO or the UN.

### Confederations and democracy inside nations

Confederation rely on the principle of mutual recognition and respect for sovereignty. This means that they do not envisage a channel of direct intervention to promote democracy within nations. Not even in blatant cases of violation of fundamental human rights - genocide, for example - is the confederation entitled to intervene in a state's domestic affairs. What happens within the nation remains its own business.

### Confederations and democracy among states

Democracy amongst nations might be very possible within confederations. However, he points out that there is very little connection to the democracy inside nations. You might have completely authoritarian regimes that are part of democratic confederations. The only requirement is that the representatives of the states are entitled to sign treaties and agreements. So you might have a democratic confederation of states that is even used to enforce tyranny within the individual nations. A historically cited examples which went into this direction is the Congress of Vienna in 1815.

### Confederations and global democracy

Within the confederal model global democracy is quite limited. Quite importantly the governments are mostly obliged to represent the interest of their individual states. This means that global problems that are not in the interest of the individual states are quite hard to solve. We all know how the discussions around global warming and environmental issues are currently going...

## The federal model

The federal model is described a substantially more rigid set of institutional rules that applies to each member state. Cited examples are Switzerland, Germany or the United States. All of them started out as confederations and increasingly centralized power to the point that they had a joint constitution with a federal government. Quite interestingly, this experience leads to a common assumption that that world peace and democracy can only be achieved through federalism and some kind of a "world government".

### Federalism and democracy inside nations

Here, Archibugi ist really skeptical if a federal model can enforce democracy within the nations. The main argument is that the world culturally just too diverse to find sufficient common ground for one joint constitution.

### Federalism and democracy among states

Here, the situation is again quite strange. Because once you have a federal model, the states have been disolved and have become part of the federal state. So there are constant struggles of competence given to the central or the federal governments. So the system of voting that existed in the confederal model is not really applicable anymore.

### Federalism and global democracy

Interestingly, a central federal power would have the authority and competence to address global problems on the basis of democratic principles. But quite interestingly it would have a fairly homogenous view on the world and be likely tempted to ignore local interests. It would be a very technocratic and top-down approach to global democracy. He cites the government of guardians dear to Plato (What is this ?).

## Cosmopolitan model

It is described as midway between confederation and federalism. Interestingly the EU is described as having elements of this. Not quite federal but certainly more than a confederation. The ambition is to have institutions that can tackle global problems and problems of massive human rights violation.

In the cosmopolitan model, the idea of sovereignty typical of the confederal and federal models is also profoundly changed. States, in fact, preserve their internal sovereignty vis-a-vis other states, but their sovereignty is eroded - including legally - by the transfer of functions to intergovernmental and non-governmental bodies. External sovereignty may also be eroded or, paraphrasing the young Kelsen, may become less 'dogmatic'


## Cosmopolitan democracy inside nations

The idea of the cosmopolitan model is that the supranational institutions have the competence to intervene in the domestic affairs of states in order to promote democracy and protect human rights.


Since one state's intervention in the domestic affairs of another has no legal foundation and may be instrumental, the cosmopolitan model entrusts civil society as opposed to national governments with the task of 'interfering' in the domestic affairs of another state.

## Cosmopolitan democracy among states

Basically it all runs through multilateralism.

## Cosmopolitan democracy and global democracy

Global issues are here transferred to global institutions, which are directly elected.

# The twelve hypothoses by David Held



the federal model at the example of Germany and the EU. This will help us later to understand the cosmopolitan democracy model better.

## Federal model - Germany

Germany is a federal republic consisting of 16 states (Bundesländer), each with its own constitution and government. The Basic Law (Grundgesetz) serves as the constitution for the entire country, establishing a division of powers between the federal government and the states. This model allows for a degree of autonomy and self-determination for each state while maintaining a unified national framework.


## Federal model - European Union

The European Union (EU) presents a unique example of a federal-like structure on a supranational level. Member states retain their sovereignty but delegate certain powers to EU institutions, creating a complex web of governance that transcends national borders. This interplay between national and supranational authority is a key feature of the federal model.
