In the last few weeks I kept wondering quite a bit about the association between democratic governance and nation-states. Somehow it is quite intrinsically connected to the notion of states and nationality. If I have the passport, I have the right to vote for some governance body et voila. In Europe this has been softed on quite a bit, but the nation remains an integral part to democratic governance models.

One model is the federal model where each institution has guiding power over the "lower" institutions. But something that I found quite interesting is the the notion of cosmopolitan democracy, which I did not know. So here we go for the moment.

I follow the paper / notes by Daniele Archibugi on cosmopolitan democracy [here](https://www.danielearchibugi.org/downloads/papers/2017/11/Principles.pdf).


First thing is that he analyses different levels of democracy:

- **Democracy inside nations**: When he was writing it he had the optimistic point of view that democracy inside a nation is a universal aspiration. In 2026 we might be hesitant to see this a universal goal by governments and citizens in all countries.

- **Democracy among states**: He describes it as respect for reciprocal sovereignty and shared norms. He mentions also the criterion of "one state one vote" as a possible democratic principle. 

- **Global democracy**: This is for global problems like climate change, migration, pandemics etc. that require global governance models. This one is especially complex as global problems easily stand in conflict with self-interests of nations. An example given there is nuclear wast. "It may, for example, be in the interest of the French public to obtain cheap nuclear energy if they manage to dispose of radioactive waste in a Pacific isle under their control, but this will obviously
be against the interests of the public living there."


## Confederal model

Archibugi defines the confederation as "an association of sovereign states which, through an appropriate treaty, reach an agreement on given issues." Big examples are NATO or the UN.

### Confederations and democracy inside nations

Confederation rely on the principle of mutual recognition and respect for sovereignty. This means that they do not envisage a channel of direct intervention to promote democracy within nations. Not even in blatant cases of violation of fundamental human rights - genocide, for example - is the confederation entitled to intervene in a state's domestic affairs. What happens within the nation remains its own business.

### Confederations and democracy among states

Democracy amongst nations might be very possible within confederations. However, he points out that there is very little connection to the democracy inside nations. You might have completely authoritarian regimes that are part of democratic confederations. The only requirement is that the representatives of the states are entitled to sign treaties and agreements. So you might have a democratic confederation of states that is even used to enforce tyranny within the individual nations. A historically cited examples which went into this direction is the Congress of Vienna in 1815.

### Confederations and global democracy

Within the confederal model global democracy is quite limited. Quite importantly the governments are mostly obliged to represent the interest of their individual states. This means that global problems that are not in the interest of the individual states are quite hard to solve. We all know how the discussions around global warming and environmental issues are currently going...

## The federal model

The federal model is described a substantially more rigid set of institutional rules that applies to each member state. Cited examples are Switzerland, Germany or the United States. All of them started out as confederations and increasingly centralized power to the point that they had a joint constitution with a federal government. Quite interestingly, this experience leads to a common assumption that that world peace and democracy can only be achieved through federalism and some kind of a "world government".

### Federalism and democracy inside nations

Here, Archibugi ist really skeptical if a federal model can enforce democracy within the nations. The main argument is that the world culturally just too diverse to find sufficient common ground for one joint constitution.

### Federalism and democracy among states

Here, the situation is again quite strange. Because once you have a federal model, the states have been disolved and have become part of the federal state. So there are constant struggles of competence given to the central or the federal governments. So the system of voting that existed in the confederal model is not really applicable anymore.

### Federalism and global democracy

Interestingly, a central federal power would have the authority and competence to address global problems on the basis of democratic principles. But quite interestingly it would have a fairly homogenous view on the world and be likely tempted to ignore local interests. It would be a very technocratic and top-down approach to global democracy. He cites the government of guardians dear to Plato (What is this ?).

## Cosmopolitan model

It is described as midway between confederation and federalism. Interestingly the EU is described as having elements of this. Not quite federal but certainly more than a confederation. The ambition is to have institutions that can tackle global problems and problems of massive human rights violation.

In the cosmopolitan model, the idea of sovereignty typical of the confederal and federal models is also profoundly changed. States, in fact, preserve their internal sovereignty vis-a-vis other states, but their sovereignty is eroded - including legally - by the transfer of functions to intergovernmental and non-governmental bodies. External sovereignty may also be eroded or, paraphrasing the young Kelsen, may become less 'dogmatic'


## Cosmopolitan democracy inside nations

The idea of the cosmopolitan model is that the supranational institutions have the competence to intervene in the domestic affairs of states in order to promote democracy and protect human rights.


Since one state's intervention in the domestic affairs of another has no legal foundation and may be instrumental, the cosmopolitan model entrusts civil society as opposed to national governments with the task of 'interfering' in the domestic affairs of another state.
