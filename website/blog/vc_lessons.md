title: My short lived contact with the world of VCs in Germany
---

For a number of years, I worked in academia on the topic of quantum et al. You can find the remainders of these activities sprinkeled over this blog. But over time it became increasingly clear to me that I would like to venture outside of this well trotten path. As this was the time where names like IonQ, IBM or Pasqal really where a super new and exciting thing to look at, I obviously also investigated the possibility of a startup.

My research experience was really quite focused on hardware development, so it felt natural to look into possibilities around this direction and I left the topic of software on the side. However, this obviously comes with  quite enormous drawbacks:

- Quantum hardware is notorisly slow to develop. To get something even close a hardware that I would nowadays consider an industrial prototype it takes you years.
- Quantum hardware is notorisly expensive, which means that you are very quickly forced to raise substantial amounts of capital for deep tech.
- Given that we have no running industrial prototypes of our tech yet, we can present the business case for the technology in any sound way.

Taken together these three conditions meant that the very first steps of the company would need 1 to 2Mâ‚¬ of funding in the seed / preseed phase. To get this amount of money we basically had two options:

- Get public funding. This comes attached with A LOT of strings, administration and is quite slow. It is nice to slowly expend out of your lab, but is not really adapted to get a startup of the ground.
- Go to the VCs and pitch your case. Sounds fast, business oriented and with a clear growth path. So we also had to look into this option.

As we started, we needed a team of at least three people, which went on a fundraising campaign. As we started to talk to the VCs it became increasingly clear that they really do not care about the tech but about the business case. But how do you explain the business case without a working prototype ? You basically have to make up the business case based on your current knowledge. And once you dream up those business cases, you have to show that they are scalable. FAST. So we had no working prototype for industrial standards, therefore no possibility to benchmark the business cases on sound numbers. Yet, we still had to present enormously ambitious business plans to the VCs.

This world was completely different to the academenic environment that I was used to. This made the beginning of the whole adventure super exciting. People are fast and responsive. They have a different perspective to your well known technical approach. They force you to think about the project in business ways that you never thought about before. On the other hand, this world is also based on enormous amounts of assumptions. With assumptions that are hard to verify for very long times. And assumptions that get stretch increasingly to make the ambitions of the VCs work. Further, these assumptions have substantial consequences. When your academic experiments fail, you do another one and move on. If your business assumptions fail you have burned massive amounts of money and everyone lost their job. Given these consequences, I personally would have liked to go the cautious route. Yet, within the process our predictions got increasingly detached from reality. At some point we had discussions with technical experts that told us that our time lines are at least by a factor of two (rather four) to optimistic. On the other hand, we had discussions with VCs that told us that our timelines were at least a factor of two (rather four) to slow to make the fundraising cycle work. Personally, this was hard to digest and eventually one of the reasons why I had to get out of this business quite quickly.

Now, you might argue that it is still all worth it because of the freedom you have and the possibility to get super mega rich right ? Well, not so fast.

- If you would like to raise 1 to 2M  in Germany VCs were asking for at least 20% of the company but we are closer to thirty.
- They also expect you to keep the equity within the company.
- You have leaver clauses which bind you for years to the company.
- With each round the shares of the owners get quite substantially diluted.

Then you can go through the different scenarios

*Scenario A: You go bust* This is what happens in something like 80% of the time. Over the years, you got your salary. It was sub industry and with enormous amounts of stress. To make the numbers simple let's say that you can assume that this scenario lost you roughly 100k (give or take) compared to your standard industry job.

*Scenario B: You muddle through* You do not go bust. You have a product. It works, but it is not quite as profiable as you would like. This is after you raised Seed (VC took 30%), Series A (VC took 30%) and now it becomes clear that a Series B will not fly. So you have to find some buyer that takes the IP of the company for 5M and move on.  This will happen approximately 15% of the time. So in this scenario, you basically end with a 500k payday as one of the founders.

*Scenario C: Payout by the big industrial player* You perform, you have raised Seed (VC took 30%), Series A (VC took 30%) and Series B (VC took 30%) and now you have pay day with a buyout of 50M. This will happen between 1 and 5 % of the time. So in this scenario, you basically end with a 5M payday.

What is the expected value of the whole enterprise ? I end up with a rough expected return of 250k give or take. So it is certainly not a loss. But is this worth the stress and the uncertainty ? This is most likely the key question that everyone has to decide.

I felt a huge amount of releave when I left this scene. I never was able to shake the imposter syndrome and could not enjoy the ride. I felt the excitement but the negative feeling were substantially stronger. Nowadays, life has moved me onto a completely different path, which I am grateful about. 

But all in all I think that I am saddest about the fact that it is so incredibly hard to get a deep tech startup off the ground in Germany. I still feel that the step from academic research and deep tech startups in Germany is so much bigger than it could be and a number of things could improve the situation quite drastically:

- Better incubators connected to Universities. For a number of Universities there is very little incentive to have good incubator programs. Hence they are rarely up the potential. This would lighten the knowledge gap of researchers as they have to discuss the wonderful world of business. I would be interested to hear about successful examples.
- Simplify the public funding process. It was really a nightmare to go through the public funding process. It genuinely felt like a bureaucracy that was only made to up to let some people feel important. Please, make it easier.
- Get us all VCs with deeper knowledge. I think that this speaks to itself.
