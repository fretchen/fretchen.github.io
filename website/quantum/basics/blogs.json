As this work is foundational to any kind of modern quantum technology, we decided to provide you here with a description of the experiments in terms of a game. While the game is slightly odd it shows you nicely how quantum mechanics allow you to break the casino and what the experiments demonstrated specifically.\n\nTo make the discussion very direct and hands-on we will implement it in some simple `qiskit` circuits such that you can test them directly on your own.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\nfrom qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit\nfrom qiskit import Aer\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom tqdm import trange\n```\n\n## The casino version of Bell's (CHSH) game\n\nA casino invented a new and exciting game, where Alice and Bob can try to win some nice objects at a huge discount together. To participate in the game they have to pay 300 € as a team, but they have a good chance to come out of the game with objects that are worth 400€. Here are the rules of the game:\n\n- Alice and Bob have to go into isolated cabins, where they get to see one out of two nice Apple watches (one being black and one being white). Quite importantly, they do not know which car was given to the other contestant.\n- Now Alice and Bob have to tell the Referee what they would like to do. They have two options. They can either say that they would like to \"sell\" the watch or \"keep\" it.\n\nAfter they told the referee, their answers are compared. They can win in the following fashion:\n\n- If Alice and Bob both saw a white watch, they win of one wanted to \"sell\" and the other one wanted to \"keep\" the car.\n- In any other case, they win if both answered the same way (\"keep\" or \"sell\")\n\nLet us simply translate these rules into python code.\n\n```python\ndef bell_game(color_a: str, color_b: str, choice_a: str, choice_b: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    The bell casino game translated into python\n\n    Args:\n      color_a: the color that Alice sees (either `black` or `white`)\n      color_b: the color that Alice sees (either `black` or `white`)\n      choice_a: the choice the Alice makes (`keep` or `sell`)\n      choice_b: the choice the Bob makes (`keep` or `sell`)\n\n    Returns:\n      A sring that says if Alice and Bob \"won\" or \"lost\"\n    \"\"\"\n    # the one case where Alice and Bob have to have different results\n    if color_a == \"white\" and color_b == \"white\":\n        if choice_a == \"keep\" and choice_b == \"sell\":\n            return \"won\"\n        if choice_a == \"sell\" and choice_b == \"keep\":\n            return \"won\"\n    else:\n        if choice_a == choice_b:\n            return \"won\"\n    return \"lost\"\n```\n\n## The best classical strategy\n\nIt turns out that the best way to win for Alice and Bob is to cooperate and decide before if they would like to \"keep\" or \"sell\" the watch. Then they will get their wish in 75% of the cases and only lose if both see a white watch. We can even simulate this casino session in simple python code\n\n```python\nn_games = 10000\nwins = np.zeros(n_games)\n\n# Alice and Bob decided to cooperate and always say \"sell\"\nchoice_alice = \"sell\"\nchoice_bob = \"sell\"\n\nfor ii in range(n_games):\n\n    # get the colors\n    color_alice = random.choice([\"black\", \"white\"])\n    color_bob = random.choice([\"black\", \"white\"])\n\n    result = bell_game(color_alice, color_bob, choice_alice, choice_bob)\n    if result == \"won\":\n        wins[ii] = 1\n\nprint(\n    \"Alice and Bob won {} games out of {}. Hence a win rate of {:.2f} %\".format(\n        wins.sum(), n_games, wins.sum() / n_games * 100\n    )\n)\n```\n\n    Alice and Bob won 7489.0 games out of 10000. Hence a win rate of 74.89 %\n\nWe can see this makes the game fair as Bob and Alice have an expectation value of exactly 300€, so the casino and the players will have just an enjoyable time if we look at the wins and losses over the games.\n\n```python\nprofit = wins * 400 - np.ones(n_games) * 300\naccu_profit = profit.cumsum()\n\nf, ax = plt.subplots()\nax.plot(accu_profit)\nax.set_ylabel(\"profit in €\")\nax.set_xlabel(\"number of games\")\nax.axhline(0, color=\"k\")\n```\n\n    <matplotlib.lines.Line2D at 0x1111181f0>\n\n![png](bell_inequalities_files/bell_inequalities_7_1.png)\n\n## Breaking the casino with quantum technologies\n\nQuite interestingly Alice and Bob could win more often if they have access to quantum technologies. So we just assume that Alice and Bob are really good techies and had access to a quantum computer, which allows them to entangle two qubits. Let us first plot up the kind of instructions that Alice and Bob have to give the quantum computer to obtain the entangled pair.\n\n```python\nsim = Aer.get_backend(\"aer_simulator\")\n\nqc = QuantumCircuit(2)\nqc.h(0)\nqc.cx(0, 1)\nqc.draw(\"mpl\")\n```\n\n![png](bell_inequalities_files/bell_inequalities_9_0.png)\n\nAs a result of the circuit they have created a pair of entangled qubits. Imagine now that Alice and Bob can each one take one of the qubits into their cabin to play the quantum game. Given that Alice and Bob have to carry the qubit they have to have it in a box with two buttons.\n\n- The first button says `measurement` such that they can read out the recommendation of their qubit.\n- The second button allows them change their personal qubit a bit once they saw if they have a white or black watch in front of them.\n- The key thing is that the box is not sending out any signal to the other player. So they are following perfectly the rules of the casino.\n\n## A naive quantum strategy\n\nA naive way of using the qubit is to simply push the `measurement` and nothing else.If the qubit results in a zero, they will tell the casino that they would like to \"keep\" the watch. If it is qubit result is a one, they decide to \"sell\" the watch.\n\nWe can just implement this once as a `qiskit` circuit and look at the result.\n\n```python\nn_games = 10000\n\nnaive_q_wins = np.zeros(n_games)\nfor ii in trange(n_games):\n\n    color_alice = random.choice([\"black\", \"white\"])\n    color_bob = random.choice([\"black\", \"white\"])\n\n    # time to prepare the Bell pair\n    qc = QuantumCircuit(2)\n    qc.h(0)\n    qc.cx(0, 1)\n\n    # both measure\n    qc.measure_all()\n\n    # now run the circuit\n    job = sim.run(qc, shots=1)\n    outcome = job.result().get_counts()\n\n    # a horribly intransparent way to get the value of the outcome\n    keys = [*outcome][0]\n    choice_alice = \"sell\" if keys[0] == \"0\" else \"keep\"\n    choice_bob = \"sell\" if keys[1] == \"0\" else \"keep\"\n\n    result = bell_game(color_alice, color_bob, choice_alice, choice_bob)\n    if result == \"won\":\n        naive_q_wins[ii] = 1\n\nprint(\"\")\nprint(\n    \"Alice and Bob won {} games out of {}. Hence a win rate of {:.2f} %\".format(\n        naive_q_wins.sum(), n_games, naive_q_wins.sum() / n_games * 100\n    )\n)\n```\n\n    100%|███████████████████████████████████| 10000/10000 [00:03<00:00, 2953.99it/s]\n\n\n    Alice and Bob won 7500.0 games out of 10000. Hence a win rate of 75.00 %\n\nAs you can see above the players right now will always make the same choice. This is just a very geeky variation of the classical strategy that we implemented above.\n\n## The winning quantum strategy\n\nBut being really good in quantum tech, Alice and Bob now also have the second button at hand to have a more sophisticated strategy, which allows them to take into account the color of the watches that they see in front of them.\n\nSo what is the physics Bob and Alice developped the following strategy:\n\n- If Alice sees a _black_ watch she simply measures her qubit.\n- If Alice sees a _white_ watch she changes her personal qubit a bit by pushing the button on her qubit bag. In physics terms, it applies a hardamard gate on her qubit. Then she measures her qubit.\n\nBob does the following:\n\n- If he sees a _white_ watch he switches the button to `white`. This performs $R_y$ a rotation of qubit by $\\frac{\\pi}{8}$.\n- If he sees a _black_ watch he switches the button to `black`. This performs $R_y$ a rotation of qubit by $-\\frac{\\pi}{8}$.\n\n```python\nn_games = 10000\n\nfancy_q_wins = np.zeros(n_games)\nfor ii in trange(n_games):\n\n    # get the numbers that tell us if Alice and Bob obtained\n    # a white or a black watch\n    color_alice = random.choice([\"black\", \"white\"])\n    color_bob = random.choice([\"black\", \"white\"])\n\n    # time to prepare the Bell pair\n    qc = QuantumCircuit(2)\n    qc.h(0)\n    qc.cx(0, 1)\n\n    # Alice acts her qubit\n    if color_alice == \"white\":\n        qc.h(0)\n\n    # Bob acts on his qubit\n    if color_bob == \"white\":\n        qc.ry(np.pi / 8, 1)\n    else:\n        qc.ry(-np.pi / 8, 1)\n\n    # both measure\n    qc.measure_all()\n\n    # now run the circuit\n    job = sim.run(qc, shots=1)\n    outcome = job.result().get_counts()\n    result = \"lost\"\n\n    # a horribly intransparent way to get the value of the outcome\n    keys = [*outcome][0]\n    choice_alice = \"sell\" if keys[0] == \"0\" else \"keep\"\n    choice_bob = \"sell\" if keys[1] == \"0\" else \"keep\"\n\n    result = bell_game(color_alice, color_bob, choice_alice, choice_bob)\n    if result == \"won\":\n        fancy_q_wins[ii] = 1\n\nprint(\"\")\nprint(\n    \"Alice and Bob won {} games out of {}. Hence a win rate of {:.2f} %\".format(\n        fancy_q_wins.sum(), n_games, fancy_q_wins.sum() / n_games * 100\n    )\n)\n```\n\n    100%|███████████████████████████████████| 10000/10000 [00:03<00:00, 2636.13it/s]\n\n\n    Alice and Bob won 8318.0 games out of 10000. Hence a win rate of 83.18 %\n\n```python\nfancy_profit = fancy_q_wins * 400 - np.ones(n_games) * 300\nfancy_accu_profit = fancy_profit.cumsum()\n\nf, ax = plt.subplots()\nax.plot(accu_profit, label=\"classical tech\", lw=3, alpha=0.5)\nax.plot(fancy_accu_profit, label=\"quantum tech\", lw=3)\nax.axhline(0, color=\"k\")\nax.set_ylabel(\"profit in €\")\nax.set_xlabel(\"number of games\")\nax.legend()\nax.set_xlim(0, n_games)\n```\n\n    (0.0, 10000.0)\n\n![png](bell_inequalities_files/bell_inequalities_15_1.png)\n\nThis graph nicely summarizes that Alice and Bob have found a clear **quantum advantage** in the game. They could break the casino if the casino let's them play long enough. It is fairly crucial to underline that Alice and Bob did not cheat in any way. They were simply able to do **more** with quantum technologies than it would be possible with any classical approach.\n\n## The link to the Nobel prize\n\nThis quantum advantage was formulated in a clean fashion in Bell's inequalities in the 1970s. The three Nobel prize winners (John Clauser, Alain Aspect, Anton Zeilinger) tested experimentally that it is indeed possible for Alice and Bob to break the casino without any cheating.\n\nOf course, the experimentalists did not take qubits into a casino. The experiments performed the game in highly controlled lab experiments. The qubits were implemented through flying photons and the decisions on the colors of the watches were high quality random number generators. Even as the experiments became more and more sophisticated they continued to show that the entangled qubits allowed for quantum advantage. And this work was so foundational to modern quantum technologies that it obtained this years [Nobel prize](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2022/press-release/). Modern quantum computing systems and sophisticated algorithms essentially attempts to reproduce this clear advantage in increasingly complex situations like [unsupervised machine learning](https://alqor.io/tutorials/introduction-to-generative-modelling-with-quantum-hardware).\n"

    "content": "# Tutorial 1 - Basic concepts of quantum technologies\n\nIn today's world, the word “quantum” evokes similar dreams, hopes and reactions like the words “blockchain” or “artificial intelligence”. Enthusiasts focus exclusively on the disruptive potential while the greater public sees it mostly as a big hype which is impossible to understand for normal people. This hipster role is rather new to the quantum sector which has largely evolved under the radar to the greater public for the last one hundred years. In this tutorial series, we will summarize some basic concepts of quantum physics and then  discuss the four pillars of quantum technologies:\n\n1. **Quantum metrology**, where we use quantum physics for precise measurements.\n2. **Quantum cryptography**, where we improve security through quantum physics.\n3. **Quantum simulation**, where we solve specific problems that are hard for normal computers with quantum systems.\n4. **Quantum computing**, where we build a new computational framework with quantum mechanics.\n\n## The esoteric beginnings of quantum physics in the 1920s\n\nTheoretical physicists like Planck, Einstein, Schrödinger or Heisenberg (before he was reborn as a drug kingpin in a TV series) founded quantum physics in the 1920s. They tried to explain rather esoteric physical effects like black body radiation or the photoelectric effect. This work proved to have major implications to our understanding of physics and became integral to the description of our world.\nThe mathematical framework behind quantum mechanics is sufficiently advanced to go well beyond high school physics, so we will skip it here. But if you have the feeling that you would like to have a deeper understanding, here are some ways of doing this:\n\n- We wrote a university lecture on the cooking recipes for quantum mechanics with plenty of references. It is a one hour summary that might get you started if you are familiar with most of the maths.\n- If you would like to get a marvelous introduction into some basic principles of quantum mechanics we recommend the absolutely outstanding Feynman lectures. \n- The books by Cohen Tannoudji give an extensive and clean introduction into quantum mechanics with discussions of numerous problems.\n\n## Two rules, no math\n\nIn this tutorial series, we discuss quantum mechanics based on two rules with no math. This beautiful description was given by Chris Monroe in a short youtube video that we highly recommend before you continue.\n\nWe will just call the rules from the video **quantum rules one and two** throughout the tutorial series.\n\n- **Quantum rule 1**: Quantum objects can be in several states at the same time. \n- **Quantum rule 2**: Rule number one only works when you are not looking.\n\nWe will see these two rules in action in every single quantum technology, but here we will visualize them directly by the famous Schrödinger cat.\n\n## Schrödingers cat\n\nErwin Schrödinger, one of the founders of quantum mechanics, illustrated the rules of quantum mechanics through the following thought experiment.\n\nIt is a thought experiment of a cat that is trapped in a box together with a closed bottle of toxic gas. A very thin filament that might snap at any time keeps a hammer above the bottle from falling. And when the hammer hits the bottle the unfortunate cat dies of poisoning. The final ingredient is that we cannot see or hear anything of what is happening within the box without opening it. So if we look at this problem through the rules of quantum mechanics two options are imaginable:\n\n- Option A: The filament holds, the bottle remains intact and the **cat stays alive**.\n- Option B: The filament snaps, the bottle breaks and the **cat is dead**.\n\n**If we can apply the rules of quantum mechanics** we know from quantum rule 1 the cat will therefore be in both states at the same time, it is dead and alive as long as the box is closed. We will often use the terms **superposition** to describe a situation where a system is in multiple states at the same time. But as soon as we open the box, we will only see it as being dead or alive according to quantum rule 2.\n\nThe art of quantum technologies is then to build up systems that follow these rules in a very controlled manner. Physicists developed increasingly refined approaches over the last one hundred years. The technologies have lead to different quantum hardware platforms based on atoms, electrons or even light. We have a whole series of tutorials on quantum hardware if you would like to know more about it. Over the years, physicists have learned to master these systems to an increasingly high degree. And it has now even been possible to realize Schrödinger's thought experiment. See for example here for a realization with atoms.\n\n## The two quantum rules in the different quantum technologies\n\nTo end this tutorial, we now discuss how we use the two rules as essential ingredients in all quantum technology stacks. We leave the much more detailed discussion to the next parts of the series.\n\n1. In **quantum metrology** we put the measurement system into a superposition in the first step (quantum rule 1). We can think of it like a coin that is tossed and rotates at a speed that might depend on gravity. We then measure the result after some time and as for any coin, we will always get heads or tails. \n2. In **quantum cryptography** we put a pair of photons into a superposition. Then, we send them to the partners that would like to communicate. If someone tries to listen to the discussion he will measure the system and destroy the superposition. Smart protocols use this to secure the communication.\n3. In **quantum simulation** physicists design a system to solve a very specific problem efficiently by testing multiple solutions in parallel. The measurement in the end allows the observers the solution to the problem.\n4. In **quantum computing** we put we computational units into superpositions. Then, smartly designed algorithms can solve certain problems more efficiently than classical computers. The final measurement is then telling the user the result of the computation.\n\n## Summary\n\nIn this tutorial we discussed basic concepts of quantum technologies. We saw that the key challenge is to implement systems that follow the two quantum rules. The designer chooses then the technologies that solve the problem at hand in the most efficient way. We will focus on quantum metrology in our next tutorial before we move on to the other pillars.\n"

    "content": "# Tutorial 2 - Quantum metrology\n\nWelcome back to our second lesson on quantum technologies. In this lesson, we will discuss how quantum systems are used for precise measurements in a variety of situations. We saw in the last lesson, that quantum physics was initially developed to explain some observations in the laboratory. However, in the 1960s and 1970s more and more lasers became accessible as a new tool for experimental physicists. They allowed brave pioneers to cool and trap individual particles. This work was purely curiosity-driven and was launched in a tiny number of university and government laboratories. It suddenly allowed people like Dave Wineland, Bill Phillipps or Claude Cohen-Tannoudji a previously unimaginable degree of control over atoms and ions. This kind of work had such an important impact on physics that it was recognized with several nobel prizes and is now used to define our measurement units like the second, the meter etc.\n\nWe will go through three specific examples and see how quantum technologies are used there.\n\n1. The measurement of time is nowadays done with atomic clocks and so precise that clocks can be used for the measurement of height.\n2. The measurement of magnetic fields is getting more and more precise thanks to quantum technologies. We are now even able to measure the magnetic fields that are created by brain activity.\n3. Measurement of forces are essential for navigation of planes and large ships. Quantum technologies are an essential tool to improve these measurement to a stage where satellites are not needed anymore.\n\n## Measuring time with atomic clocks\n\nPrecise time keeping is essential to mondern industry. Financial services are highly timed, navigation depends on the precise timing of the GPS satellites and we are all following the same time of the network time protocol. And nowadays time is kept with increasingly precise atomic clocks, which are one of the earliest quantum technologies we have. A few reasons which atomic clocks are such marvelous time keepers are:\n\n- No need to get the american, chinese or european atom as they are all equal. Once we agreed with other how we measure time with atoms we all have exactly the tools at hand.\n- Atomic clocks a extremely precise. Commercially available rubidium clocks (for a few thousand euros) are precise to within 10^{-11}. Modern research has push this to 10^{-21} as described in this paper.\n\n## How do atomic clocks roughly ?\n\nYou might have heard that atoms consist of a nucleus which is positively charged and a bunch of negatively charged electrons circling around this nucleus. And as for satellites that orbit around earth, their speed is different in different orbits. So, electrons that are closer to the core, in a lower orbit, take less time to circle around the core than electrons that that further away, in a higher orbit. And it was one of the first discoveries by quantum mechanics that only a number of very specific orbits with sharply defined frequencies are allowed.\n\n![Atoms](AtomWithOrbits.png)\n\nAnd then then electrons can then jump from one orbit to another if you shine in microwave radiation at the corresponding frequency. Yes, it is the same kind of radiation that heats up your food in the microwave oven. Except that here the radiation does not heat the atom it just makes the electron jump to another orbit. And this highly controlled transition of the electron between two orbits is what atomic clocks are building upon. Actually, we have now defined the second based on this idea. The definition reads:\n\n> The second, symbol $s$, is the SI unit of time. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the caesium frequency $\\Delta \\nu_\\text{Cs}$, the unperturbed ground-state hyperfine transition frequency of the caesium-133 atom, to be 9 192 631 770 when expressed in the > unit Hz, which is equal to $s^{-1}$.\n>\n> From the website of the [bureau international des poids et des measures](https://www.bipm.org/en/si-base-units/second).\n\nIf you have some time, we also recommend you to have a look into the [talk by Nobel prize Bill Philipps](https://youtu.be/8WWQrD_TzaY), where he gives a highly entertaining introduction.\n\nA more scientific discussion can be found in this [detailled review](https://arxiv.org/abs/1407.3493) paper.\n\n## Measuring magnetic fields\n\n[Compasses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_compass) have been used for navigation of 2000 years now. This makes the measurement of magnetic field is one of the long standing tools of navigation that we have. And the precise measurement of magnetic fields remains a major industrial challenge, where the most precise magnetometers are nowadays based on quantum technologies. Most of them of a similar approach as they measure the influence of the magnetic field on electrons. The existence of the magnetic field slightly changes how the electrons would like to move. So looking back to the electrons in an atom, it means that the frequency of each orbit is shifted slightly. And as all the orbits are slightly different, each of them experiences a slightly different energy shift.\n\n![AtomsWithField](AtomWithOrbitsUnderMagneticField.png)\n\nWe can measure this energy shifts very precisely. And hence we can use very precise frequency measurements for very precise magnetometry. They are nowadays pushing the frontiers of nanotechnology, brain studies and space science as you might read in [this review](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.00618.pdf). The described principle is not limited to atoms. Similiar approaches are used in magnetometers which are based on diamonds, commercialized by companies like [Wainvam-e](https://wainvam-e.com/), or superconducting loops, commercialized by companies like [QuantumDesign](https://qd-europe.com/de/en/products/magnetism/magnetometers/). The magnetic field always slightly shifts around a frequency and we measure this shift precisely.\n\n## Measuring forces\n\nThis kind of precision measurements is also available for the measurement of forces. Whenever, you change your speed or direction, this means that a force is applied onto you. So if you are able to precisely measure the forces that you experience at a certain moment in time, you always know where you are compared to your starting point. Suppose that you would like to take a ship that travels the Atlantic. Then you could theoretically do the whole travel only based on your force measurements. Unfortunately, these measurements have to be extremely precise and we currently have to rely on satellite navigation (which relies on atomic clocks).\n\nHowever, some well established companies like [iXBlue](https://www.ixblue.com/quantum-gravimeter/) in France or [AOSense](https://aosense.com/) in the US can offer ultraprecise sensors to their customers. These sensors are based on the [movement of ultracold atoms](https://www.ixblue.com/first-3-axis-quantum-inertial-sensor/). The sensing power is so high that it provides new possibilities for navigation of vessels that might have no access to satellite navigation, i.e. submarines. In other words, it makes for an interesting technology for the military which is one of the bigger investors and clients into quantum sensors. However, the hefty price tag and the close connection to military applications explain why this sector still remains fairly unknown to the public despite its clearly established use-cases and growing importance to various important industries.\n\n## Summary\n\nIn this lesson, we have discussed three very distinct examples of quantum metrology. We also discussed how this enables new industrial measurements already today. However, given the fairly high price of those tools, they are often only understood by a group of experts.\n"
